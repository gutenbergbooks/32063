<p><span class="bold"> <a name="ar1" id="ar1">CONDUCTION, ELECTRIC.</a></span> The electric conductivity of a
substance is that property in virtue of which all its parts come
spontaneously to the same electric potential if the substance is
kept free from the operation of electric force. Accordingly, the
reciprocal quality, electric resistivity, may be defined as a
quality of a substance in virtue of which a difference of potential
can exist between different portions of the body when these are
in contact with some constant source of electromotive force, in
such a manner as to form part of an electric circuit.</p>

<p>All material substances possess in some degree, large or small,
electric conductivity, and may for the sake of convenience be
broadly divided into five classes in this respect. Between these,
however, there is no sharply-marked dividing line, and the
classification must therefore be accepted as a more or less
arbitrary one. These divisions are: (1) metallic conductors,
(2) non-metallic conductors, (3) dielectric conductors, (4) electrolytic
conductors, (5) gaseous conductors. The first class comprises
all metallic substances, and those mixtures or combinations
of metallic substances known as alloys. The second includes
such non-metallic bodies as carbon, silicon, many of the oxides
and peroxides of the metals, and probably also some oxides of
the non-metals, sulphides and selenides. Many of these substances,
for instance carbon and silicon, are well-known to have
the property of existing in several allotropic forms, and in some
of these conditions, so far from being fairly good conductors,
they may be almost perfect non-conductors. An example of
this is seen in the case of carbon in its three allotropic conditions&mdash;charcoal,
graphite and diamond. As charcoal it possesses a
fairly well-marked but not very high conductivity in comparison
with metals; as graphite, a conductivity about one-four-hundredth
of that of iron; but as diamond so little conductivity
that the substance is included amongst insulators or non-conductors.
The third class includes those substances which are
generally called insulators or non-conductors, but which are
better denominated dielectric conductors; it comprises such
solid substances as mica, ebonite, shellac, india-rubber, gutta-percha,
paraffin, and a large number of liquids, chiefly hydrocarbons.
These substances differ greatly in insulating power,
and according as the conductivity is more or less marked, they
are spoken of as bad or good insulators. Amongst the latter
many of the liquid gases hold a high position. Thus, liquid
oxygen and liquid air have been shown by Sir James Dewar
to be almost perfect non-conductors of electricity.</p>

<p>The behaviour of substances which fall into these three classes
is discussed below in section I., dealing with metallic conduction.</p>

<p>The fourth class, namely the electrolytic conductors comprises
all those substances which undergo chemical decomposition
when they form part of an electric circuit traversed by an
electric current. They are discussed in section II., dealing with
electrolytic conduction.</p>

<p>The fifth and last class of conductors includes the gases. The
conditions under which this class of substance becomes possessed
of electric conductivity are considered in section III., on conduction
in gases.</p>

<p>In connexion with metallic conductors, it is a fact of great
interest and considerable practical importance, that, although
the majority of metals when in a finely divided or powdered
condition are practically non-conductors, a mass of metallic
powder or filings may be made to pass suddenly into a conductive
condition by being exposed to the influence of an electric wave.
The same is true of the loose contact of two metallic conductors.
Thus if a steel point, such as a needle, presses very lightly
against a metallic plate, say of aluminium, it is found that this
metallic contact, if carefully adjusted, is non-conductive, but
that if an electric wave is created anywhere in the neighbourhood,
this non-conducting contact passes into a conductive state.
This fact, investigated and discovered independently by D. E.
Hughes, C. Onesti, E. Branly, O. J. Lodge and others, is applied
in the construction of the &ldquo;coherer,&rdquo; or sensitive tube employed
as a detector or receiver in that form of &ldquo;wireless telegraphy&rdquo;
chiefly developed by Marconi. Further references to it are
made in the articles <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electric Waves</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Telegraphy</a></span>:

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>International Ohm.</i>&mdash;The practical unit of electrical resistance
was legally defined in Great Britain by the authority of the queen
in council in 1894, as the &ldquo;resistance offered to an invariable electric
current by a column of mercury at the temperature of melting ice,
14.4521 grammes in mass, of a constant cross-sectional area, and a
length 106.3 centimetres.&rdquo; The same unit has been also legalized
as a standard in France, Germany and the United States, and is
denominated the &ldquo;International or Standard Ohm.&rdquo; It is intended
to represent as nearly as possible a resistance equal to 10° absolute
C.G.S. units of electric resistance. Convenient multiples and subdivisions
of the ohm are the microhm and the megohm, the former
being a millionth part of an ohm, and the latter a million ohms.
The resistivity of substances is then numerically expressed by stating
the resistance of one cubic centimetre of the substance taken between
opposed faces, and expressed in ohms, microhms or megohms, as
may be most convenient. The reciprocal of the ohm is called the
mho, which is the unit of conductivity, and is defined as the conductivity
of a substance whose resistance is one ohm. The absolute
unit of conductivity is the conductivity of a substance whose resistivity
is one absolute C.G.S. unit, or one-thousandth-millionth part
of an ohm. Resistivity is a quality in which material substances
differ very widely. The metals and alloys, broadly speaking, are
good conductors, and their resistivity is conveniently expressed in
microhms per cubic centimetre, or in absolute C.G.S. units. Very
small differences in density and in chemical purity make, however,
immense differences in electric resistivity; hence the values given
by different experimentalists for the resistivity of known metals
differ to a considerable extent.</p>
</div>

<p class="center1">I. <span class="sc">Conduction in Solids</span></p>

<p>It is found convenient to express the resistivity of metals in two
different ways: (1) We may state the resistivity of one cubic
centimetre of the material in microhms or absolute units taken
between opposed faces. This is called the <i>volume-resistivity</i>; (2)
we may express the resistivity by stating the resistance in ohms
offered by a wire of the material in question of uniform cross-section
one metre in length, and one gramme in weight. This
numerical measure of the resistivity is called the <i>mass-resistivity</i>.
The mass-resistivity of a body is connected with its volume-resistivity
and the density of the material in the following
manner:&mdash;The mass-resistivity, expressed in microhms per metre-gramme,
divided by 10 times the density is numerically equal to
the volume-resistivity per centimetre-cube in absolute C.G.S.
units. The mass-resistivity per metre-gramme can always be
obtained by measuring the resistance and the mass of any wire of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page856" id="page856"></a>856</span>
uniform cross-section of which the length is known, and if the
density of the substance is then measured, the volume-resistivity
can be immediately calculated.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>If R is the resistance in ohms of a wire of length l, uniform cross-section
s, and density d, then taking &rho; for the volume-resistivity we
have 10<span class="sp">9</span>R = &rho;l/s; but lsd = M, where M is the mass of the wire.
Hence 10<span class="sp">9</span>R = &rho;dl<span class="sp">2</span>/M. If l = 100 and M = 1, then R = &rho;&prime;= resistivity in
ohms per metre-gramme, and 10<span class="sp">9</span>&rho;&prime; = 10,000d&rho;, or &rho; = 10<span class="sp">5</span>&rho;&prime;/d, and
&rho;&prime; = 10,000MR/l<span class="sp">2</span>.</p>

<p>The following rules, therefore, are useful in connexion with
these measurements. To obtain the mass-resistivity per metre-gramme
of a substance in the form of a uniform metallic wire:&mdash;Multiply
together 10,000 times the mass in grammes and the total
resistance in ohms, and then divide by the square of the length in
centimetres. Again, to obtain the volume-resistivity in C.G.S. units
per centimetre-cube, the rule is to multiply the mass-resistivity in
ohms by 100,000 and divide by the density. These rules, of course,
apply only to wires of uniform cross-section. In the following
Tables I., II. and III. are given the mass and volume resistivity of
ordinary metals and certain alloys expressed in terms of the international
ohm or the absolute C.G.S. unit of resistance, the values
being calculated from the experiments of A. Matthiessen (1831-1870)
between 1860 and 1865, and from later results obtained by
J. A. Fleming and Sir James Dewar in 1893.</p>

<p>The data commonly used for calculating metallic resistivities
were obtained by A. Matthiessen, and his results are set out in the
Table II. which is taken from Cantor lectures given by Fleeming
Jenkin in 1866 at or about the date when the researches were made.
The figures given by Jenkin have, however, been reduced to international
ohms and C.G.S. units by multiplying by (&pi;/4)&times;0.9866 &times;
10<span class="sp">5</span> = 77,485.</p>

<p>Subsequently numerous determinations of the resistivity of various
pure metals were made by Fleming and Dewar, whose results are
set out in Table III.</p>

<p><i>Resistivity of Mercury.</i>&mdash;The volume-resistivity of pure mercury
is a very important electric constant, and since 1880 many of the
most competent experimentalists have directed their attention to
the determination of its value. The experimental process has
usually been to fill a glass tube of known dimensions, having large
cup-like extensions at the ends, with pure mercury, and determine
the absolute resistance of this column of metal. For the practical
details of this method the following references may be consulted:&mdash;&ldquo;The
Specific Resistance of Mercury,&rdquo; Lord Rayleigh and Mrs Sidgwick,
<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1883, part i. p. 173, and R. T. Glazebrook, <i>Phil.
Mag.</i>, 1885, p. 20; &ldquo;On the Specific Resistance of Mercury,&rdquo; R. T.
Glazebrook and T. C. Fitzpatrick, <i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1888, p. 179, or <i>Proc.
Roy. Soc.</i>, 1888, p. 44, or <i>Electrician</i>, 1888, 21, p. 538; &ldquo;Recent
Determinations of the Absolute Resistance of Mercury,&rdquo; R. T. Glazebrook,
<i>Electrician</i>, 1890, 25, pp. 543 and 588. Also see J. V. Jones,
&ldquo;On the Determination of the Specific Resistance of Mercury in
Absolute Measure,&rdquo; <i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1891, A, p. 2. Table IV. gives
the values of the volume-resistivity of mercury as determined by
various observers, the constant being expressed (a) in terms of the
resistance in ohms of a column of mercury one millimetre in cross-section
and 100 centimetres in length, taken at 0° C.; and (b) in terms
of the length in centimetres of a column of mercury one square millimetre
in cross-section taken at 0° C. The result of all the most careful
determinations has been to show that the resistivity of pure
mercury at 0° C. is about 94,070 C.G.S. electromagnetic units of
resistance, and that a column of mercury 106.3 centimetres in length
having a cross-sectional area of one square millimetre would have a
resistance at 0° C. of one international ohm. These values have
accordingly been accepted as the official and recognized values for
the specific resistance of mercury, and the definition of the ohm.
The table also states the methods which have been adopted by the
different observers for obtaining the absolute value of the resistance
of a known column of mercury, or of a resistance coil afterwards
compared with a known column of mercury. A column of figures
is added showing the value in fractions of an international ohm of
the British Association Unit (B.A.U.), formerly supposed to represent
the true ohm. The real value of the B.A.U. is now taken as .9866
of an international ohm.</p>

<p>For a critical discussion of the methods which have
been adopted in the absolute determination of the
resistivity of mercury, and the value of the British
Association unit of resistance, the reader may be referred
to the <i>British Association Reports</i> for 1890 and
1892 (<i>Report of Electrical Standards Committee</i>), and to
the <i>Electrician</i>, 25, p. 456, and 29, p. 462. A discussion
of the relative value of the results obtained between
1882 and 1890 was given by R. T. Glazebrook
in a paper presented to the British Association at
Leeds, 1890.</p>

<p><i>Resistivity of Copper.</i>&mdash;In connexion with electro-technical
work the determination of the conductivity
or resistivity values of annealed and hard-drawn copper
wire at standard temperatures is a very important
matter. Matthiessen devoted considerable attention
to this subject between the years 1860 and 1864 (see
<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1860, p. 150), and since that time much
additional work has been carried out. Matthiessen&rsquo;s
value, known as <i>Matthiessen&rsquo;s Standard</i>, for the mass-resistivity
of pure hard-drawn copper wire, is the
resistance of a wire of pure hard-drawn copper one
metre long and weighing one gramme, and this is
equal to 0.14493 international ohms at 0° C. For
many purposes it is more convenient to express temperature
in Fahrenheit degrees, and the recommendation
of the 1899 committee on copper conductors<a name="FnAnchor_8" id="FnAnchor_8" href="#Footnote_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> is as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Matthiessen&rsquo;s standard for hard-drawn conductivity
commercial copper shall be considered to be
the resistance of a wire of pure hard-drawn copper one
metre long, weighing one gramme which at
60° F. is 0.153858 international ohms.&rdquo;
Matthiessen also measured the mass-resistivity
of annealed copper, and found that its
conductivity is greater than that of hard-drawn
copper by about 2.25% to 2.5%
As annealed copper may vary considerably
in its state of annealing, and is always
somewhat hardened by bending and winding,
it is found in practice that the resistivity of
commercial annealed copper is about 1¼%
less than that of hard-drawn copper. The
standard now accepted for such copper, on
the recommendation of the 1899 Committee,
is a wire of pure annealed copper one metre
long, weighing one gramme, whose resistance
at 0° C. is 0.1421 international ohms, or at
60° F., 0.150822 international ohms. The
specific gravity of copper varies from about
8.89 to 8.95, and the standard value accepted
for high conductivity commercial copper is
8.912, corresponding to a weight of 555 lb
per cubic foot at 60° F. Hence the volume-resistivity
of pure annealed copper at 0° C. is
1.594 microhms per c.c., or 1594 C.G.S. units,
and that of pure hard-drawn copper at 0° C. is
1.626 microhms per c.c., or 1626 C.G.S. units.
Since Matthiessen&rsquo;s researches, the most careful
scientific investigation on the conductivity
of copper is that of T. C. Fitzpatrick,
carried out in 1890. (<i>Brit. Assoc. Report</i>, 1890,
Appendix 3, p. 120.) Fitzpatrick confirmed
Matthiessen&rsquo;s chief result, and obtained values
for the resistivity of hard-drawn copper which,
when corrected for temperature variation, are
in entire agreement with those of Matthiessen
at the same temperature.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, an alloy having high resistivity has poor
mechanical qualities, that is to say, its tensile strength and ductility
are small. It is possible to form alloys having a resistivity as high
as 100 microhms per cubic centimetre; but, on the other hand, the
value of an alloy for electro-technical purposes is judged not merely
by its resistivity, but also by the degree to which its resistivity varies
with temperature, and by its capability of being easily drawn into
fine wire of not very small tensile strength. Some pure metals when
alloyed with a small proportion of another metal do not suffer much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page858" id="page858"></a>858</span>
change in resistivity, but in other cases the resultant alloy has a
much higher resistivity. Thus an alloy of pure copper with 3% of
aluminium has a resistivity about 5½ times that of copper; but if
pure aluminium is alloyed with 6% of copper, the resistivity of the
product is not more than 20% greater than that of pure aluminium.
The presence of a very small proportion of a non-metallic element in
a metallic mass, such as oxygen, sulphur or phosphorus, has a very
great effect in increasing the resistivity. Certain metallic elements
also have the same power; thus platinoid has a resistivity 30%
greater than German silver, though it differs from it merely in
containing a trace of tungsten.</p>
</div>

<p>The resistivity of non-metallic conductors is in all cases higher
than that of any pure metal. The resistivity of carbon, for
instance, in the forms of charcoal or carbonized organic material
and graphite, varies from 600 to 6000 microhms per cubic
centimetre, as shown in Table VI.:&mdash;</p>

<p>The resistivity of liquids is, generally speaking, much higher
than that of any metals, metallic alloys or non-metallic conductors.
Thus fused lead chloride, one of the best conducting
liquids, has a resistivity in its fused condition of 0.376 ohm per
centimetre-cube, or 376,000 microhms per centimetre-cube,
whereas that of metallic alloys only in few cases exceeds 100
microhms per centimetre-cube. The resistivity of solutions of
metallic salts also varies very largely with the proportion of the
diluent or solvent, and in some instances, as in the aqueous
solutions of mineral acids; there is a maximum conductivity
corresponding to a certain dilution. The resistivity of many
liquids, such as alcohol, ether, benzene and pure water, is so high,

<p>Effects of Heat.&mdash;Temperature affects the resistivity of these
different classes of conductors in different ways. In all cases, so
far as is yet known, the resistivity of a pure metal is increased if
its temperature is raised, and decreased if the temperature is
lowered, so that if it could be brought to the absolute zero of
temperature (-273° C.) its resistivity would be reduced to a very
small fraction of its resistance at ordinary temperatures. With
metallic alloys, however, rise of temperature does not always
increase resistivity: it sometimes diminishes it, so that many
alloys are known which have a maximum resistivity corresponding
to a certain temperature, and at or near this point they vary very
little in resistance with temperature. Such alloys have, therefore,
a negative temperature-variation of resistance at and above
fixed temperatures. Prominent amongst these metallic compounds
are alloys of iron, manganese, nickel and copper, some
of which were discovered by Edward Weston, in the United
States. One well-known alloy of copper, manganese and nickel,
now called manganin, which was brought to the notice of
electricians by the careful investigations made at the Berlin
Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, is characterized by
having a zero temperature coefficient at or about a certain
temperature in the neighbourhood of 15° C. Hence within a
certain range of temperature on either side of this critical value
the resistivity of manganin is hardly affected at all by temperature.
Similar alloys can be produced from copper and ferro-manganese.
An alloy formed of 80% copper and 20%
manganese in an annealed condition has a nearly zero temperature-variation
of resistance between 20° C. and 100° C. In
the case of non-metals the action of temperature is generally
to diminish the resistivity as temperature rises, though this is not
universally so. The interesting observation has been recorded by
J. W. Howell, that &ldquo;treated&rdquo; carbon filaments and graphite are
substances which have a minimum resistance corresponding to a
certain temperature approaching red heat (<i>Electrician</i>, vol.
xxxviii. p. 835). At and beyond this temperature increased
heating appears to increase their resistivity; this phenomenon
may, however, be accompanied by a molecular change and not be
a true temperature variation. In the case of dielectric conductors
and of electrolytes, the action of rising temperature is to reduce
resistivity. Many of the so-called insulators, such as mica,
ebonite, indiarubber, and the insulating oils, paraffin, &amp;c.,
decrease in resistivity with great rapidity as the temperature
rises. With guttapercha a rise in temperature from 0° C. to
24° C. is sufficient to reduce the resistivity of one-twentieth part
of its value at 0° C., and the resistivity of flint glass at 140° C.
is only one-hundredth of what it is at 60° C.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A definition may here be given of the meaning of the term <i>Temperature
Coefficient</i>. If, in the first place, we suppose that the resistivity
(&rho;<span class="su">t</span>) at any temperature (t) is a simple linear function of the resistivity
(&rho;<span class="su">0</span>) at 0° C., then we can write &rho;<span class="su">t</span> = &rho;<span class="su">0</span>(1 + &alpha;t), or &alpha; = (&rho;<span class="su">t</span> &minus; &rho;<span class="su">0</span>)/&rho;<span class="su">0</span>t.</p>

<p>The quantity &alpha; is then called the temperature-coefficient, and its
reciprocal is the temperature at which the resistivity would become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page859" id="page859"></a>859</span>
zero. By an extension of this notion we can call the quantity
d&rho;/&rho;dt the temperature coefficient corresponding to any temperature
t at which the resistivity is &rho;. In all cases the relation between the
resistivity of a substance and the temperature is best set out in the
form of a curve called a temperature-resistance curve. If a series of
such curves are drawn for various pure metals, temperature being
taken as abscissa and resistance as ordinate, and if the temperature
range extends from the absolute zero of temperature upwards, then
it is found that these temperature-resistance lines are curved lines
having their convexity either upwards or downwards. In other
words, the second differential coefficient of resistance with respect
to temperature is either a positive or negative quantity. An extensive
series of observations concerning the form of the resistivity
curves for various pure metals over a range of temperature extending
from -200° C. to +200° C. was carried out in 1892 and 1893 by
Fleming and Dewar (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> Oct. 1892 and Sept. 1893).
The resistance observations were taken with resistance coils constructed
with wires of various metals obtained in a state of great
chemical purity. The lengths and mean diameters of the wires were
carefully measured, and their resistance was then taken at certain
known temperatures obtained by immersing the coils in boiling
aniline, boiling water, melting ice, melting carbonic acid in ether,
and boiling liquid oxygen, the temperatures thus given being
+184°.5 C., +100° C., 0° C., -78°.2 C. and -182°.5 C. The
resistivities of the various metals were then calculated and set out
in terms of the temperature. From these data a chart was prepared
showing the temperature-resistance curves of these metals
throughout a range of 400 degrees. The exact form of these curves
through the region of temperature lying between -200° C. and
-273° C. is not yet known. As shown on the chart, the curves
evidently do not converge to precisely the same point. It is, however,
much less probable that the resistance of any metal should
vanish at a temperature above the absolute zero than at the absolute
zero itself, and the precise path of these curves at their lower ends
cannot be delineated until means are found for fixing independently
the temperature of some regions in which the resistance of metallic
wires can be measured. Sir J. Dewar subsequently showed that for
certain pure metals it is clear that the resistance would not vanish
at the absolute zero but would be reduced to a finite but small value
(see &ldquo;Electric Resistance Thermometry at the Temperature of
Boiling Hydrogen,&rdquo; <i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> 1904, 73, p. 244).</p>

<p>The resistivity curves of the magnetic metals are also remarkable
for the change of curvature they exhibit at the magnetic critical
temperature. Thus J. Hopkinson and D. K. Morris (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>
September 1897, p. 213) observed the remarkable alteration that
takes place in the iron resistance temperature curve in the neighbourhood
of 780° C. At that temperature the direction of the
curvature of the curve changes so that it becomes convex upwards
instead of convex downwards, and in addition the value of the
temperature coefficient undergoes a great reduction. The mean
temperature coefficient of iron in the neighbourhood of 0° C. is
0.0057; at 765° C. it rises to a maximum value 0.0204; but at
1000° C. it falls again to a lower value, 0.00244. A similar rise to
a maximum value and subsequent fall are also noted in the case of
the specific heat of iron. The changes in the curvature of the resistivity
curves are undoubtedly connected with the molecular changes
that occur in the magnetic metals at their critical temperatures.</p>

<p>A fact of considerable interest in connexion with resistivity is the
influence exerted by a strong magnetic field in the case of some
metals, notably bismuth. It was discovered by A. Righi and confirmed
by S. A. Leduc (<i>Journ. de Phys.</i> 1886, 5, p. 116, and 1887,
6, p. 189) that if a pure bismuth wire is placed in a magnetic field
transversely to the direction of the magnetic field, its resistance is
considerably increased. This increase is greatly affected by the
temperature of the metal (Dewar and Fleming, <i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> 1897,
60, p. 427). The temperature coefficient of pure copper is an important
constant, and its value as determined by Messrs Clark,
Forde and Taylor in terms of Fahrenheit temperature is</p>

<p class="center1">&rho;<span class="su">t</span> = &rho;<span class="su">32</span> {1 + 0.0023708(t &minus; 32) + 0.0000034548(t &minus; 32)²}.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Time Effects.</i>&mdash;In the case of dielectric conductors, commonly
called insulators, such as indiarubber, guttapercha, glass and
mica, the electric resistivity is not only a function of the temperature
but also of the time during which the electromotive
force employed to measure it is imposed. Thus if an indiarubber-covered
cable is immersed in water and the resistance of the
dielectric between the copper conductor and the water measured
by ascertaining the current which can be caused to flow through
it by an electromotive force, this current is found to vary very
rapidly with the time during which the electromotive force is
applied. Apart from the small initial effect due to the electrostatic
capacity of the cable, the application of an electromotive
force to the dielectric produces a current through it which
rapidly falls in value, as if the electric resistance of the dielectric
were increasing. The current, however, does not fall continuously
but tends to a limiting value, and it appears that if the
electromotive force is kept applied to the cable for a prolonged
time, a small and nearly constant current will ultimately be
found flowing through it. It is customary in electro-technical
work to consider the resistivity of the dielectric as the value it has
after the electromotive force has been applied for one minute, the
standard temperature being 75° F. This, however, is a purely
conventional proceeding, and the number so obtained does not
necessarily represent the true or ohmic resistance of the dielectric.
If the electromotive force is increased, in the case of a large
number of ordinary dielectrics the apparent resistance at the end
of one minute&rsquo;s electrification decreases as the electromotive
force increases.</p>

<p><i>Practical Standards.</i>&mdash;The practical measurement of resistivity
involves many processes and instruments (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Wheatstone&rsquo;s
Bridge</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ohmmeter</a></span>). Broadly speaking, the
processes are divided into <i>Comparison Methods</i> and <i>Absolute
Methods</i>. In the former a comparison is effected between the
resistance of a material in a known form and some standard
resistance. In the <i>Absolute Methods</i> the resistivity is determined
without reference to any other substance, but with reference
only to the fundamental standards of length, mass and time.
Immense labour has been expended in investigations concerned
with the production of a standard of resistance and its evaluation
in absolute measure. In some cases the absolute standard is
constructed by filling a carefully-calibrated tube of glass with
mercury, in order to realize in a material form the official definition
of the ohm; in this manner most of the principal national
physical laboratories have been provided with standard mercury
ohms. (For a full description of the standard mercury ohm of
the Berlin Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, see the
<i>Electrician</i>, xxxvii. 569.) For practical purposes it is more convenient
to employ a standard of resistance made of wire.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Opinion is not yet perfectly settled on the question whether a
wire made of any alloy can be considered to be a perfectly unalterable
standard of resistance, but experience has shown that a platinum
silver alloy (66% silver, 33% platinum), and also the alloy called
manganin, seem to possess the qualities of permanence essential for
a wire-resistance standard. A comparison made in 1892 and 1894
of all the manganin wire copies of the ohm made at the Reichsanstalt
in Berlin, showed that these standards had remained constant for
two years to within one or two parts in 100,000. It appears, however,
that in order that manganin may remain constant in resistivity when
used in the manufacture of a resistance coil, it is necessary that the
alloy should be <i>aged</i> by heating it to a temperature of 140° C. for ten
hours; and to prevent subsequent changes in resistivity, solders
containing zinc must be avoided, and a silver solder containing 75%
of silver employed in soldering the manganin wire to its connexions.</p>
</div>

<p>The authorities of the Berlin Reichsanstalt have devoted
considerable attention to the question of the best form for a wire
standard of electric resistance. In that now adopted the resistance
wire is carefully insulated and wound on a brass cylinder,
being doubled on itself to annul inductance as much as possible.
In the coil two wires are wound on in parallel, one being much
finer than the other, and the final adjustment of the coil to an
exact value is made by shortening the finer of the two. A
standard of resistance for use in a laboratory now generally
consists of a wire of manganin or platinum-silver carefully
insulated and enclosed in a brass case. Thick copper rods are
connected to the terminals of the wire in the interior of the case,
and brought to the outside, being carefully insulated at the same
time from one another and from the case. The coil so constructed
can be placed under water or paraffin oil, the temperature of
which can be exactly observed during the process of taking a
resistance measurement. Equalization of the temperature of
the surrounding medium is effected by the employment of a
stirrer, worked by hand or by a small electric motor. The
construction of a standard of electrical resistance consisting of
mercury in a glass tube is an operation requiring considerable
precautions, and only to be undertaken by those experienced
in the matter. Opinions are divided on the question whether
greater permanence in resistance can be secured by mercury-in-glass
standards of resistance or by wire standards, but the latter
are at least more portable and less fragile.</p>

<p class="center1">II. <span class="sc">Conduction in Liquids</span></p>

<p>Through liquid metals, such as mercury at ordinary temperatures
and other metals at temperatures above their melting
points, the electric current flows as in solid metals without
changing the state of the conductor, except in so far as heat is
developed by the electric resistance. But another class of liquid
conductors exists, and in them the phenomena are quite
different. The conductivity of fused salts, and of solutions of
salts and acids, although less than that of metals, is very great
compared with the traces of conductivity found in so-called non-conductors.
In fused salts and conducting solutions the passage
of the current is always accompanied by definite chemical
changes; the substance of the conductor or electrolyte is
decomposed, and the products of the decomposition appear at the
electrodes, <i>i.e.</i> the metallic plates by means of which the current
is led into and out of the solution. The chemical phenomena are
considered in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electrolysis</a></span>; we are here concerned
solely with the mechanism of this <i>electrolytic</i> conduction of the
current.</p>

<p>To explain the appearance of the products of decomposition at
the electrodes only, while the intervening solution is unaltered,
we suppose that, under the action of the electric forces, the
opposite parts of the electrolyte move in opposite directions
through the liquid. These opposite parts, named ions by
Faraday, must therefore be associated with electric charges, and
it is the convective movement of the opposite streams of ions
carrying their charges with them that, on this view, constitutes
the electric current.</p>

<p>In metallic conduction it is found that the current is proportional
to the applied electromotive force&mdash;a relation known by
the name of Ohm&rsquo;s law. If we place in a circuit with a small
electromotive force an electrolytic cell consisting of two platinum
electrodes and a solution, the initial current soon dies away, and
we shall find that a certain minimum electromotive force must be
applied to the circuit before any considerable permanent current
passes. The chemical changes which are initiated on the surfaces
of the electrodes set up a reverse electromotive force of polarization,
and, until this is overcome, only a minute current, probably
due to the slow but steady removal of the products of decomposition
from the electrodes by a process of diffusion, will pass
through the cell. Thus it is evident that, considering the
electrolytic cell as a whole, the passage of the current through it
cannot conform to Ohm&rsquo;s law. But the polarization is due to
chemical changes, which are confined to the surfaces of the
electrodes; and it is necessary to inquire whether, if the polarization
at the electrodes be eliminated, the passage of the current
through the bulk of the solution itself is proportional to the
electromotive force actually applied to that solution. Rough
experiment shows that the current is proportional to the excess of
the electromotive force over a constant value, and thus verifies
the law approximately, the constant electromotive force to be
overcome being a measure of the polarization. A more satisfactory
examination of the question was made by F. Kohlrausch
in the years 1873 to 1876. Ohm&rsquo;s law states that the current C
is proportional to the electromotive force E, or C = kR, where k is
a constant called the conductivity of the circuit. The equation
may also be written as C = E/R, where R is a constant, the
reciprocal of k, known as the resistance of the circuit. The
essence of the law is the proportionality between C and E, which
means that the ratio E/C is a constant. But E/C = R, and thus
the law may be tested by examining the constancy of the
measured resistance of a conductor when different currents are
passing through it. In this way Ohm&rsquo;s law has been confirmed in
the case of metallic conduction to a very high degree of accuracy.
A similar principle was applied by Kohlrausch to the case of
electrolytes, and he was the first to show that an electrolyte
possesses a definite resistance which has a constant value when
measured with different currents and by different experimental
methods.</p>

<p><i>Measurement of the Resistance of Electrolytes.</i>&mdash;There are two
effects of the passage of an electric current which prevent the
possibility of measuring electrolytic resistance by the ordinary
methods with the direct currents which are used in the case of
metals. The products of the chemical decomposition of the
electrolyte appear at the electrodes and set up the opposing
electromotive force of polarization, and unequal dilution of the
solution may occur in the neighbourhood of the two electrodes.
The chemical and electrolytic aspects of these phenomena are
treated in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electrolysis</a></span>, but from our present point
of view also it is evident that they are again of fundamental
importance. The polarization at the surface of the electrodes
will set up an opposing electromotive force, and the unequal
dilution of the solution will turn the electrolyte into a concentration
cell and produce a subsidiary electromotive force either in
the same direction as that applied or in the reverse according
as the anode or the cathode solution becomes the more dilute.
Both effects thus involve internal electromotive forces, and
prevent the application of Ohm&rsquo;s law to the electrolytic cell as a
whole. But the existence of a definite measurable resistance as a
characteristic property of the system depends on the conformity
of the system to Ohm&rsquo;s law, and it is therefore necessary to
eliminate both these effects before attempting to measure the
resistance.</p>

<p>The usual and most satisfactory method of measuring the
resistance of electrolytes consists in eliminating the effects of
polarization by the use of alternating currents, that is, currents
that are reversed in direction many times a second.<a name="FnAnchor_11" id="FnAnchor_11" href="#Footnote_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> The
chemical action produced by the first current is thus reversed by
the second current in the opposite direction, and the polarization
caused by the first current on the surface of the electrodes is
destroyed before it rises to an appreciable value. The polarization
is also diminished in another way. The electromotive force
of polarization is due to the deposition of films of the products of
chemical decomposition on the surface of the electrodes, and
only reaches its full value when a continuous film is formed. If
the current be stopped before such a film is completed, the
reverse electromotive force is less than its full value. A given
current flowing for a given time deposits a definite amount of
substance on the electrodes, and therefore the amount per unit
area is inversely proportional to the area of the electrodes&mdash;to
the area of contact, that is, between the electrode and the liquid.
Thus, by increasing the area of the electrodes, the polarization due
to a given current is decreased. Now the area of free surface of a
platinum plate can be increased enormously by coating the plate
with platinum black, which is metallic platinum in a spongy
state, and with such a plate as electrode the effects of polarization
are diminished to a very marked extent. The coating is effected
by passing an electric current first one way and then the other
between two platinum plates immersed in a 3% solution of
platinum chloride to which a trace of lead acetate is sometimes
added. The platinized plates thus obtained are quite satisfactory
for the investigation of strong solutions. They have the power,
however, of absorbing a certain amount of salt from the solutions
and of giving it up again when water or more dilute solution is
placed in contact with them. The measurement of very dilute
solutions is thus made difficult, but, if the plates be heated to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page861" id="page861"></a>861</span>
redness after being platinized, a grey surface is obtained which
possesses sufficient area for use with dilute solutions and yet does
not absorb an appreciable quantity of salt.</p>

<p>Any convenient source of alternating current may be used.
The currents from the secondary circuit of a small induction coil
are satisfactory, or the currents of an alternating electric light
supply may be transformed down to an electromotive force of one
or two volts. With such currents it is necessary to consider the
effects of self-induction in the circuit and of electrostatic capacity.
In balancing the resistance of the electrolyte, resistance coils may
be used in which self-induction and the capacity are reduced
to a minimum by winding the wire of the coil backwards and
forwards in alternate layers.</p>

<p>With these arrangements the usual method of measuring
resistance by means of Wheatstone&rsquo;s bridge may be adapted to
the case of electrolytes. With alternating currents, however,
it is impossible to use a galvanometer in the usual way. The
galvanometer was therefore replaced by Kohlrausch by a
telephone, which gives a sound
when an alternating current
passes through it. The most common
plan of the apparatus is
shown diagrammatically in fig. 1.
The electrolytic cell and a resistance
box form two arms of the
bridge, and the sliding contact is
moved along the metre wire which
forms the other two arms till no
sound is heard in the telephone.
The resistance of the electrolyte is to that of the box as that
of the right-hand end of the wire is to that of the left-hand
end. A more accurate method of using alternating currents,
and one more pleasant to use, gets rid of the telephone
(<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1900, 194, p. 321). The current from one or two
voltaic cells is led to an ebonite drum turned by a motor or
a hand-wheel and cord. On the drum are fixed brass strips
with wire brushes touching them in such a manner that the
current from the brushes is reversed several times in each
revolution of the drum. The wires from the brushes are connected
with the Wheatstone&rsquo;s bridge. A moving coil galvanometer
is used as indicator, its connexions being reversed in time
with those of the battery by a slightly narrower set of brass
strips fixed on the other end of the ebonite commutator. Thus
any residual current through the galvanometer is direct and not
alternating. The high moment of inertia of the coil makes the
period of swing slow compared with the period of alternation of
the current, and the slight periodic disturbances are thus prevented
from affecting the galvanometer. When the measured
resistance is not altered by increasing the speed of the commutator
or changing the ratio of the arms of the bridge, the
disturbing effects may be considered to be eliminated.</p>

<p>The form of vessel chosen to contain the electrolyte depends
on the order of resistance to be measured. For dilute solutions
the shape of cell shown in
fig. 2 will be found convenient,
while for more concentrated
solutions, that indicated in fig.
3 is suitable. The absolute
resistances of certain solutions
have been determined by
Kohlrausch by comparison
with mercury, and, by using one of these solutions in any
cell, the constant of that cell may be found once for all.
From the observed resistance of any given solution in the
cell the resistance of a centimetre cube&mdash;the so-called specific
resistance&mdash;may be calculated. The reciprocal of this, or
the conductivity, is a more generally useful constant;
it is conveniently expressed in terms of a unit equal to the
reciprocal of an ohm. Thus Kohlrausch found that a solution of
potassium chloride, containing one-tenth of a gram equivalent
(7.46 grams) per litre, has at 18° C. a specific resistance of 89.37
ohms per centimetre cube, or a conductivity of 1.119&times;10<span class="sp">-2</span>
mhos or 1.119&times;10<span class="sp">-11</span> C.G.S. units. As the temperature variation
of conductivity is large, usually about 2% per degree, it is
necessary to place the resistance cell in a paraffin or water bath,
and to observe its temperature with some accuracy.</p>

<p>Another way of eliminating the effects of polarization and of
dilution has been used by W. Stroud and J. B. Henderson
(<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1897 [5], 43, p. 19). Two of the arms of a Wheatstone&rsquo;s
bridge are composed of narrow tubes filled with the
solution, the tubes being of equal diameter but of different
length. The other two arms are made of coils of wire of equal
resistance, and metallic resistance is added to the shorter tube
till the bridge is balanced. Direct currents of somewhat high
electromotive force are used to work the bridge. Equal currents
then flow through the two tubes; the effects of polarization and
dilution must be the same in each, and the resistance added to the
shorter tube must be equal to the resistance of a column of liquid
the length of which is equal to the difference in length of the two
tubes.</p>

<p>A somewhat different principle was adopted by E. Bouty in
1884. If a current be passed through two resistances in series by
means of an applied electromotive force, the electric potential
falls from one end of the resistances to the other, and, if we apply
Ohm&rsquo;s law to each resistance in succession, we see that, since for
each of them E = CR, and C the current is the same through both,
E the electromotive force or fall of potential between the ends of
each resistance must be proportional to the resistance between
them. Thus by measuring the potential difference between the
ends of the two resistances successively, we may compare their
resistances. If, on the other hand, we can measure the potential
difference in some known units, and similarly measure the current
flowing, we can determine the resistance of a single electrolyte.
The details of the apparatus may vary, but its principle is
illustrated in the following description. A narrow glass tube is
fixed horizontally into side openings in two glass vessels, and an
electric current passed through it by means of platinum electrodes
and a battery of considerable electromotive force. In this way a
steady fall of electric potential is set up along the length of the
tube. To measure the potential difference between the ends of
the tube, tapping electrodes are constructed, <i>e.g.</i> by placing zinc
rods in vessels with zinc sulphate solution and connecting these
vessels (by means of thin siphon tubes also filled with solution)
with the vessels at the ends of the long tube which contains the
electrolyte to be examined. Whatever be the contact potential
difference between zinc and its solution, it is the same at both
ends, and thus the potential difference between the zinc rods is
equal to that between the liquid at the two ends of the tube.
This potential difference may be measured without passing any
appreciable current through the tapping electrodes, and thus the
resistance of the liquid deduced.</p>

<p><i>Equivalent Conductivity of Solutions.</i>&mdash;As is the case in the
other properties of solutions, the phenomena are much more
simple when the concentration is small than when it is great, and
a study of dilute solutions is therefore the best way of getting an
insight into the essential principles of the subject. The foundation
of our knowledge was laid by Kohlrausch when he had developed
the method of measuring electrolyte resistance described above.
He expressed his results in terms of &ldquo;equivalent conductivity,&rdquo;
that is, the conductivity (k) of the solution divided by the number
(m) of gram-equivalents of electrolyte per litre. He finds that, as
the concentration diminishes, the value of k/m approaches a
limit, and eventually becomes constant, that is to say, at great
dilution the conductivity is proportional to the concentration.
Kohlrausch first prepared very pure water by repeated distillation
and found that its resistance continually increased as the process
of purification proceeded. The conductivity of the water, and of
the slight impurities which must always remain, was subtracted
from that of the solution made with it, and the result, divided
by m, gave the equivalent conductivity of the substance dissolved.
This procedure appears justifiable, for as long as conductivity is
proportional to concentration it is evident that each part of the
dissolved matter produces its own independent effect, so that the
total conductivity is the sum of the conductivities of the parts;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page862" id="page862"></a>862</span>
when this ceases to hold, the concentration of the solution has in
general become so great that the conductivity of the solvent may
be neglected. The general result of these experiments can be
represented graphically by plotting <i>k/m</i> as ordinates and <span class="sp">3</span>&radic;<span class="ov">m</span>
as abscissae, <span class="sp">3</span>&radic;<span class="ov">m</span> being a number proportional to the reciprocal
of the average distance between the molecules, to which it seems
likely that the molecular conductivity may be related. The
general types of curve for a simple neutral salt like potassium or
sodium chloride and for a caustic alkali or acid are shown in fig. 4.
The curve for the neutral salt comes to a limiting value; that for
the acid attains a maximum at a certain very small concentration,
and falls again when the dilution
is carried farther. It has usually
been considered that this destruction
of conductivity is due to
chemical action between the acid
and the residual impurities in the
water. At such great dilution these
impurities are present in quantities
comparable with the amount of acid
which they convert into a less
highly conducting neutral salt. In
the case of acids, then, the maximum
must be taken as the limiting
value. The decrease in equivalent conductivity at great dilution
is, however, so constant that this explanation seems insufficient.
The true cause of the phenomenon may perhaps be connected
with the fact that the bodies in which it occurs, acids and
alkalis, contain the ions, hydrogen in the one case, hydroxyl in
the other, which are present in the solvent, water, and have,
perhaps because of this relation, velocities higher than those of any
other ions. The values of the molecular conductivities of all
neutral salts are, at great dilution, of the same order of magnitude,
while those of acids at their maxima are about three times as
large. The influence of increasing concentration is greater in the
case of salts containing divalent ions, and greatest of all in such
cases as solutions of ammonia and acetic acid, which are substances
of very low conductivity.</p>

<p><i>Theory of Moving Ions.</i>&mdash;Kohlrausch found that, when the
polarization at the electrodes was eliminated, the resistance of a
solution was constant however determined, and thus established
Ohm&rsquo;s Law for electrolytes. The law was confirmed in the case
of strong currents by G. F. Fitzgerald and F. T. Trouton (<i>B.A.
Report</i>, 1886, p. 312). Now, Ohm&rsquo;s Law implies that no work is
done by the current in overcoming reversible electromotive
forces such as those of polarization. Thus the molecular interchange
of ions, which must occur in order that the products may
be able to work their way through the liquid and appear at the
electrodes, continues throughout the solution whether a current is
flowing or not. The influence of the current on the ions is
merely directive, and, when it flows, streams of electrified ions
travel in opposite directions, and, if the applied electromotive
force is enough to overcome the local polarization, give up their
charges to the electrodes. We may therefore represent the facts
by considering the process of electrolysis to be a kind of convection.
Faraday&rsquo;s classical experiments proved that when a current
flows through an electrolyte the quantity of substance liberated
at each electrode is proportional to its chemical equivalent
weight, and to the total amount of electricity passed. Accurate
determinations have since shown that the mass of an ion deposited
by one electromagnetic unit of electricity, <i>i.e.</i> its electro-chemical
equivalent, is 1.036&times;10<span class="sp">-4</span>&times;its chemical equivalent
weight. Thus the amount of electricity associated with one
gram-equivalent of any ion is 10<span class="sp">4</span>/1.036 = 9653 units. Each
monovalent ion must therefore be associated with a certain
definite charge, which we may take to be a natural unit of
electricity; a divalent ion carries two such units, and so on.
A cation, <i>i.e.</i> an ion giving up its charge at the cathode, as the
electrode at which the current leaves the solution is called, carries
a positive charge of electricity; an anion, travelling in the
opposite direction, carries a negative charge. It will now be seen
that the quantity of electricity flowing per second, <i>i.e.</i> the current
through the solution, depends on (1) the number of the ions
concerned, (2) the charge on each ion, and (3) the velocity with
which the ions travel past each other. Now, the number of ions
is given by the concentration of the solution, for even if all the
ions are not actively engaged in carrying the current at the same
instant, they must, on any dynamical idea of chemical equilibrium,
be all active in turn. The charge on each, as we have
seen, can be expressed in absolute units, and therefore the
velocity with which they move past each other can be calculated.
This was first done by Kohlrausch (<i>Göttingen Nachrichten</i>, 1876,
p. 213, and <i>Das Leitvermögen der Elektrolyte</i>, Leipzig, 1898)
about 1879.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In order to develop Kohlrausch&rsquo;s theory, let us take, as an example,
the case of an aqueous solution of potassium chloride, of concentration
n gram-equivalents per cubic centimetre. There will then
be n gram-equivalents of potassium ions and the same number of
chlorine ions in this volume. Let us suppose that on each gram-equivalent
of potassium there reside +e units of electricity, and on
each gram-equivalent of chlorine ions -e units. If u denotes the
average velocity of the potassium ion, the positive charge carried
per second across unit area normal to the flow is n e u. Similarly, if
v be the average velocity of the chlorine ions, the negative charge
carried in the opposite direction is n e v. But positive electricity
moving in one direction is equivalent to negative electricity moving
in the other, so that, before changes in concentration sensibly supervene,
the total current, C, is ne(u + v). Now let us consider the
amounts of potassium and chlorine liberated at the electrodes by
this current. At the cathode, if the chlorine ions were at rest, the
excess of potassium ions would be simply those arriving in one second,
namely, nu. But since the chlorine ions move also, a further separation
occurs, and nv potassium ions are left without partners. The
total number of gram-equivalents liberated is therefore n(u + v).
By Faraday&rsquo;s law, the number of grams liberated is equal to the
product of the current and the electro-chemical equivalent of the
ion; the number of gram-equivalents therefore must be equal to
&eta;C, where &eta; denotes the electro-chemical equivalent of hydrogen in
C.G.S. units. Thus we get</p>

<p class="center1">n(u + v) = &eta;C = &eta;ne(u + v),</p>

<p class="noind">and it follows that the charge, e, on 1 gram-equivalent of each kind
of ion is equal to 1/&eta;. We know that Ohm&rsquo;s Law holds good for
electrolytes, so that the current C is also given by k·dP/dx, where
k denotes the conductivity of the solution, and dP/dx the potential
gradient, <i>i.e.</i> the change in potential per unit length along the lines of
current flow. Thus</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr> <td>n</td> <td rowspan="2">(u + v) = kdP/dx;</td></tr>
<tr> <td class="denom">&eta;</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">therefore</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">u + v = &eta;</td>
    <td>k</td> <td rowspan="2">&nbsp;</td> <td>dP</td> <td rowspan="2">.</td></tr>
<tr> <td class="denom">n</td> <td class="denom">dx</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Now &eta; is 1.036&times;10<span class="sp">-4</span>, and the concentration of a solution is usually
expressed in terms of the number, m, of gram-equivalents per litre
instead of per cubic centimetre. Therefore</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">u + v = 1.036&times;10<span class="sp">-1</span></td>
    <td>k</td> <td rowspan="2">&nbsp;</td> <td>dP</td> <td rowspan="2">.</td></tr>
<tr> <td class="denom">m</td> <td class="denom">dx</td></tr></table>

<p>When the potential gradient is one volt (10<span class="sp">8</span> C.G.S. units) per
centimetre this becomes</p>

<p class="center1">u + v = 1.036&times;10<span class="sp">-7</span>&times;k/m.</p>

<p>Thus by measuring the value of k/m, which is known as the
equivalent conductivity of the solution, we can find u + v, the
velocity of the ions relative to each other. For instance, the equivalent
conductivity of a solution of potassium chloride containing one-tenth
of a gram-equivalent per litre is 1119&times;10<span class="sp">-13</span> C.G.S. units at
18° C. Therefore</p>

<p class="center1">u + v = 1.036&times;10<span class="sp">7</span>&times;1119&times;10<span class="sp">-13</span>
= 1.159&times;10<span class="sp">-3</span> = 0.001159 cm. per sec.</p>

<p>In order to obtain the absolute velocities u and v, we must find
some other relation between them. Let us resolve u into ½(u + v)
in one direction, say to the right, and ½(u &minus; v) to the left. Similarly
v can be resolved into ½(v + u) to the left and ½(v &minus; u) to the right.
On pairing these velocities we have a combined movement of the
ions to the right, with a speed of ½(u &minus; v) and a drift right and left,
past each other, each ion travelling with a speed of ½(u + v), constituting
the electrolytic separation. If u is greater than v, the combined
movement involves a concentration of salt at the cathode, and a
corresponding dilution at the anode, and <i>vice versa</i>. The rate at
which salt is electrolysed, and thus removed from the solution at
each electrode, is ½(u + v). Thus the total loss of salt at the cathode
is ½(u + v) &minus; ½(u &minus; v) or v, and at the anode, ½(v + u) &minus; ½(v &minus; u), or u.
Therefore, as is explained in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electrolysis</a></span>, by measuring
the dilution of the liquid round the electrodes when a current passed,
W. Hittorf (<i>Pogg. Ann.</i>, 1853-1859, 89, p. 177; 98, p. 1; 103, p. 1; 106,
pp. 337 and 513) was able to deduce the ratio of the two velocities,
for simple salts when no complex ions are present, and many further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page863" id="page863"></a>863</span>
experiments have been made on the subject (see <i>Das Leitvermögen
der Elektrolyte</i>).</p>

<p>By combining the results thus obtained with the sum of the
velocities, as determined from the conductivities, Kohlrausch calculated
the absolute velocities of different ions under stated conditions.
Thus, in the case of the solution of potassium chloride
considered above, Hittorf&rsquo;s experiments show us that the ratio of
the velocity of the anion to that of the cation in this solution is
.51 : .49. The absolute velocity of the potassium ion under unit
potential gradient is therefore 0.000567 cm. per sec., and that of
the chlorine ion 0.000592 cm. per sec. Similar calculations can
be made for solutions of other concentrations, and of different
substances.</p>

<p>Table IX. shows Kohlrausch&rsquo;s values for the ionic velocities of
three chlorides of alkali metals at 18° C, calculated for a potential
gradient of 1 volt per cm.; the numbers are in terms of a unit

<p>These numbers show clearly that there is an increase in ionic
velocity as the dilution proceeds. Moreover, if we compare the
values for the chlorine ion obtained from observations on these
three different salts, we see that as the concentrations diminish
the velocity of the chlorine ion becomes the same in all of them.
A similar relation appears in other cases, and, in general, we may
say that at great dilution the velocity of an ion is independent of
the nature of the other ion present. This introduces the conception
of specific ionic velocities, for which some values at 18° C.
are given by Kohlrausch in Table X.:&mdash;</p>

<p>Having obtained these numbers we can deduce the conductivity
of the dilute solution of any salt, and the comparison of the
calculated with the observed values furnished the first confirmation
of Kohlrausch&rsquo;s theory. Some exceptions, however, are
known. Thus acetic acid and ammonia give solutions of much
lower conductivity than is indicated by the sum of the specific
ionic velocities of their ions as determined from other compounds.
An attempt to find in Kohlrausch&rsquo;s theory some explanation of
this discrepancy shows that it could be due to one of two causes.
Either the velocities of the ions must be much less in these
solutions than in others, or else only a fractional part of the
number of molecules present can be actively concerned in conveying
the current. We shall return to this point later.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Friction on the Ions.</i>&mdash;It is interesting to calculate the magnitude
of the forces required to drive the ions with a certain velocity. If
we have a potential gradient of 1 volt per centimetre the electric
force is 10<span class="sp">8</span> in C.G.S. units. The charge of electricity on 1 gram-equivalent
of any ion is 1/.0001036 = 9653 units, hence the mechanical
force acting on this mass is 9653&times;10<span class="sp">8</span> dynes. This, let us say,
produces a velocity u; then the force required to produce unit
velocity is P<span class="su">A</span> = 9.653&times;10<span class="sp">11</span>/u dynes = 9.84&times;10<span class="sp">5</span>/u kilograms-weight.
If the ion have an equivalent weight A, the force producing unit velocity
when acting on 1 gram is P<span class="su">1</span> = 9.84&times;10<span class="sp">5</span>/Au kilograms-weight.
Thus the aggregate force required to drive 1 gram of potassium ions with
a velocity of 1 centimetre per second through a very dilute solution

<p>Since the ions move with uniform velocity, the frictional resistances
brought into play must be equal and opposite to the driving
forces, and therefore these numbers also represent the ionic friction
coefficients in very dilute solutions at 18° C.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Direct Measurement of Ionic Velocities.</i>&mdash;Sir Oliver Lodge was
the first to directly measure the velocity of an ion (<i>B.A. Report</i>,
1886, p. 389). In a horizontal glass tube connecting two vessels
filled with dilute sulphuric acid he placed a solution of sodium
chloride in solid agar-agar jelly. This solid solution was made
alkaline with a trace of caustic soda in order to bring out the red
colour of a little phenol-phthalein added as indicator. An
electric current was then passed from one vessel to the other. The
hydrogen ions from the anode vessel of acid were thus carried
along the tube, and, as they travelled, decolourized the phenol-phthalein.
By this method the velocity of the hydrogen ion
through a jelly solution under a known potential gradient was
observed to about 0.0026 cm. per sec, a number of the same
order as that required by Kohlrausch&rsquo;s theory. Direct determinations
of the velocities of a few other ions have been made by
W. C. D. Whetham (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> vol. 184, A, p. 337; vol. 186, A,
p. 507; <i>Phil. Mag.</i>, October 1894). Two solutions having one
ion in common, of equivalent concentrations, different densities,
different colours, and nearly equal specific resistances, were
placed one over the other in a vertical glass tube. In one case,
for example, decinormal solutions of potassium carbonate and
potassium bichromate were used. The colour of the latter is due
to the presence of the bichromate group, Cr<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span>. When a current
was passed across the junction, the anions CO<span class="su">3</span> and Cr<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span>
travelled in the direction opposite to that of the current, and
their velocity could be determined by measuring the rate at which
the colour boundary moved. Similar experiments were made
with alcoholic solutions of cobalt salts, in which the velocities of
the ions were found to be much less than in water. The behaviour
of agar jelly was then investigated, and the velocity of an ion
through a solid jelly was shown to be very little less than in
an ordinary liquid solution. The velocities could therefore be
measured by tracing the change in colour of an indicator or the
formation of a precipitate. Thus decinormal jelly solutions of
barium chloride and sodium chloride, the latter containing a trace
of sodium sulphate, were placed in contact. Under the influence
of an electromotive force the barium ions moved up the
tube, disclosing their presence by the trace of insoluble barium
sulphate formed. Again, a measurement of the velocity of
the hydrogen ion, when travelling through the solution of an
acetate, showed that its velocity was then only about the
one-fortieth part of that found during its passage through
chlorides. From this, as from the measurements on alcohol
solutions, it is clear that where the equivalent conductivities are
very low the effective velocities of the ions are reduced in the
same proportion.</p>

<p>Another series of direct measurements has been made by Orme
Masson (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> vol. 192, A, p. 331). He placed the gelatine
solution of a salt, potassium chloride, for example, in a horizontal
glass tube, and found the rate of migration of the potassium and
chlorine ions by observing the speed at which they were replaced
when a coloured anion, say, the Cr<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span> from a solution of potassium
bichromate, entered the tube at one end, and a coloured cation,
say, the Cu from copper sulphate, at the other. The coloured
ions are specifically slower than the colourless ions which they
follow, and in this case it follows that the coloured solution has a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page864" id="page864"></a>864</span>
higher resistance than the colourless. For the same current,
therefore, the potential gradient is higher in the coloured solution
and lower in the colourless one. Thus a coloured ion which gets
in front of the advancing boundary finds itself acted on by a
smaller force and falls back into line, while a straggling colourless
ion is pushed forward again. Hence a sharp boundary is preserved.
B. D. Steele has shown that with these sharp boundaries
the use of coloured ions is unnecessary, the junction line being
visible owing to the difference in the optical refractive indices of
two colourless solutions. Once the boundary is formed, too, no
gelatine is necessary, and the motion can be watched through
liquid aqueous solutions (see R. B. Denison and B. D. Steele,
<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1906).</p>

<p>All the direct measurements which have been made on simple
binary electrolytes agree with Kohlrausch&rsquo;s results within the
limits of experimental error. His theory, therefore, probably
holds good in such cases, whatever be the solvent, if the proper
values are given to the ionic velocities, <i>i.e.</i> the values expressing
the velocities with which the ions actually move in the solution
of the strength taken, and under the conditions of the experiment.
If we know the specific velocity of any one ion, we can deduce,
from the conductivity of very dilute solutions, the velocity of any
other ion with which it may be associated, a proceeding which
does not involve the difficult task of determining the migration
constant of the compound. Thus, taking the specific ionic
velocity of hydrogen as 0.00032 cm. per second, we can find, by
determining the conductivity of dilute solutions of any acid, the
specific velocity of the acid radicle involved. Or again, since we
know the specific velocity of silver, we can find the velocities of a
series of acid radicles at great dilution by measuring the conductivity
of their silver salts.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>By such methods W. Ostwald, G. Bredig and other observers have
found the specific velocities of many ions both of inorganic and
organic compounds, and examined the relation between constitution
and ionic velocity. The velocity of elementary ions is found to
be a periodic function of the atomic weight, similar elements lying
on corresponding portions of a curve drawn to express the relation
between these two properties. Such a curve much resembles that
giving the relation between atomic weight and viscosity in solution.
For complex ions the velocity is largely an additive property; to
a continuous additive change in the composition of the ion corresponds
a continuous but decreasing change in the velocity. The
following table gives Ostwald&rsquo;s results for the formic acid series:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nature of Electrolytes.</i>&mdash;We have as yet said nothing about the
fundamental cause of electrolytic activity, nor considered why,
for example, a solution of potassium chloride is a good conductor,
while a solution of sugar allows practically no current to pass.</p>

<p>All the preceding account of the subject is, then, independent
of any view we may take of the nature of electrolytes, and stands
on the basis of direct experiment. Nevertheless, the facts
considered point to a very definite conclusion. The specific
velocity of an ion is independent of the nature of the opposite ion
present, and this suggests that the ions themselves, while
travelling through the liquid, are dissociated from each other.
Further evidence, pointing in the same direction, is furnished by
the fact that since the conductivity is proportional to the
concentration at great dilution, the equivalent-conductivity, and
therefore the ionic velocity, is independent of it. The importance
of this relation will be seen by considering the alternative to the
dissociation hypothesis. If the ions are not permanently free
from each other their mobility as parts of the dissolved molecules
must be secured by continual interchanges. The velocity with
which they work their way through the liquid must then increase
as such molecular rearrangements become more frequent, and will
therefore depend on the number of solute molecules, <i>i.e.</i> on the
concentration. On this supposition the observed constancy of
velocity would be impossible. We shall therefore adopt as a
wording hypothesis the theory, confirmed by other phenomena
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electrolysis</a></span>), that an electrolyte consists of dissociated ions.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that neither the evidence in favour of the
dissociation theory which is here considered, nor that described
in the article <span class="sc">Electrolysis</span>, requires more than the effective
dissociation of the ions from each other. They may well be
connected in some way with solvent molecules, and there are
several indications that an ion consists of an electrified part of the
molecule of the dissolved salt with an attendant atmosphere of
solvent round it. The conductivity of a salt solution depends on
two factors&mdash;(1) the fraction of the salt ionized; (2) the velocity
with which the ions, when free from each other, move under the
electric forces.<a name="FnAnchor_12" id="FnAnchor_12" href="#Footnote_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> When a solution is heated, both these factors may
change. The coefficient of ionization usually, though not always,
decreases; the specific ionic velocities increase. Now the rate of
increase with temperature of these ionic velocities is very nearly
identical with the rate of decrease of the viscosity of the liquid.
If the curves obtained by observations at ordinary temperatures
be carried on they indicate a zero of fluidity and a zero of ionic
velocity about the same point, 38.5° C. below the freezing point of
water (Kohlrausch, <i>Sitz. preuss. Akad. Wiss.</i>, 1901, 42, p. 1026).
Such relations suggest that the frictional resistance to the motion
of an ion is due to the ordinary viscosity of the liquid, and that the
ion is analogous to a body of some size urged through a viscous
medium rather than to a particle of molecular dimensions finding
its way through a crowd of molecules of similar magnitude.
From this point of view W. K. Bousfield has calculated the sizes
of ions on the assumption that Stokes&rsquo;s theory of the motion of a
small sphere through a viscous medium might be applied (<i>Zeits.
phys. Chem.</i>, 1905, 53, p. 257; <i>Phil. Trans.</i> A, 1906, 206, p. 101).
The radius of the potassium or chlorine ion with its envelope of
water appears to be about 1.2&times;10<span class="sp">-8</span> centimetres.</p>

<p class="center1">III. <span class="sc">Electric Conduction through Gases</span></p>

<p>A gas such as air when it is under normal conditions conducts
electricity to a small but only to a very small extent, however
small the electric force acting on the gas may be. The electrical
conductivity of gases not exposed to special conditions is so
small that it was only definitely established in the early years
of the 20th century, although it had engaged the attention of
physicists for more than a hundred years. It had been known
for a long time that a body charged with electricity slowly lost
its charge even when insulated with the greatest care, and though
long ago some physicists believed that part of the leak of
electricity took place through the air, the general view seems to
have been that it was due to almost unavoidable defects in the
insulation or to dust in the air, which after striking the charged
body was repelled from it and went off with some of the charge.
C. A. Coulomb, who made some very careful experiments which
were published in 1785 (<i>Mém. de l&rsquo;Acad. des Sciences</i>, 1785, p.
612), came to the conclusion that after allowing for the leakage
along the threads which supported the charged body there was
a balance over, which he attributed to leakage through the air.
His view was that when the molecules of air come into contact
with a charged body some of the electricity goes on to the molecules,
which are then repelled from the body carrying their
charge with them. We shall see later that this explanation is
not tenable. C. Matteucci (<i>Ann. chim. phys.</i>, 1850, 28, p. 390)
in 1850 also came to the conclusion that the electricity from a
charged body passes through the air; he was the first to prove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page865" id="page865"></a>865</span>
that the rate at which electricity escapes is less when the pressure
of the gas is low than when it is high. He found that the rate
was the same whether the charged body was surrounded by air,
carbonic acid or hydrogen. Subsequent investigations have
shown that the rate in hydrogen is in general much less than in
air. Thus in 1872 E. G. Warburg (<i>Pogg. Ann.</i>, 1872, 145, p. 578)
found that the leak through hydrogen was only about one-half
of that through air: he confirmed Matteucci&rsquo;s observations on
the effect of pressure on the rate of leak, and also found that it
was the same whether the gas was dry or damp. He was inclined
to attribute the leak to dust in the air, a view which was
strengthened by an experiment of J. W. Hittorf&rsquo;s (<i>Wied. Ann.</i>,
1879, 7, p. 595), in which a small carefully insulated electroscope,
placed in a small vessel filled with carefully filtered gas, retained
its charge for several days; we know now that this was due to
the smallness of the vessel and not to the absence of dust, as it
has been proved that the rate of leak in small vessels is less than
in large ones.</p>

<p>Great light was thrown on this subject by some experiments
on the rates of leak from charged bodies in closed vessels made
almost simultaneously by H. Geitel (<i>Phys. Zeit.</i>, 1900, 2, p. 116)
and C. T. R. Wilson (<i>Proc. Camb. Phil.</i> Soc., 1900, 11, p. 32).
These observers established that (1) the rate of escape of electricity
in a closed vessel is much smaller than in the open, and
the larger the vessel the greater is the rate of leak; and (2) the rate
of leak does not increase in proportion to the differences of
potential between the charged body and the walls of the vessel:
the rate soon reaches a limit beyond which it does not increase,
however much the potential difference may be increased, provided,
of course, that this is not great enough to cause sparks to pass
from the charged body. On the assumption that the maximum
leak is proportional to the volume, Wilson&rsquo;s experiments, which
were made in vessels less than 1 litre in volume, showed that in
dust-free air at atmospheric pressure the maximum quantity
of electricity which can escape in one second from a charged
body in a closed volume of V cubic centimetres is about 10<span class="sp">-8</span>V
electrostatic units. E. Rutherford and S. T. Allan (<i>Phys. Zeit.</i>,
1902, 3, p. 225), working in Montreal, obtained results in close
agreement with this. Working between pressures of from
43 to 743 millimetres of mercury, Wilson showed that the
maximum rate of leak is very approximately proportional to
the pressure; it is thus exceedingly small when the pressure
is low&mdash;a result illustrated in a striking way by an experiment
of Sir W. Crookes (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i>, 1879, 28, p. 347) in which a
pair of gold leaves retained an electric charge for several months
in a very high vacuum. Subsequent experiments have shown
that it is only in very small vessels that the rate of leak is proportional
to the volume and to the pressure; in large vessels
the rate of leak per unit volume is considerably smaller than in
small ones. In small vessels the maximum rate of leak in different
gases, is, with the exception of hydrogen, approximately proportional
to the density of the gas. Wilson&rsquo;s results on this point are
shown in the following table (Proc. Roy. Soc., 1901, 60, p. 277):&mdash;</p>

<p>The rate of leak of electricity through gas contained in a closed
vessel depends to some extent on the material of which the walls
of the vessel are made; thus it is greater, other circumstances
being the same, when the vessel is made of lead than when it is
made of aluminium. It also varies, as Campbell and Wood
(<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [6], 13, p. 265) have shown, with the time of the day,
having a well-marked minimum at about 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning:
it also varies from month to month. Rutherford (<i>Phys. Rev.</i>,
1903, 16, p. 183), Cooke (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1903 [6], 6, p. 403) and
M&rsquo;Clennan and Burton (<i>Phys. Rev.</i>, 1903, 16, p. 184) have shown
that the leak in a closed vessel can be reduced by about 30%
by surrounding the vessel with sheets of thick lead, but that the
reduction is not increased beyond this amount, however thick
the lead sheets may be. This result indicates that part of the
leak is due to a very penetrating kind of radiation, which can get
through the thin walls of the vessel but is stopped by the thick
lead. A large part of the leak we are describing is due to the
presence of radioactive substances such as radium and thorium
in the earth&rsquo;s crust and in the walls of the vessel, and to the
gaseous radioactive emanations which diffuse from them into
the atmosphere. This explains the very interesting effect
discovered by J. Elster and H. Geitel (<i>Phys. Zeit.</i>, 1901, 2, p. 560),
that the rate of leak in caves and cellars when the air is stagnant
and only renewed slowly is much greater than in the open air.
In some cases the difference is very marked; thus they found
that in the cave called the Baumannshöhle in the Harz mountains
the electricity escaped at seven times the rate it did in the air
outside. In caves and cellars the radioactive emanations from
the walls can accumulate and are not blown away as in the
open air.</p>

<p>The electrical conductivity of gases in the normal state is,
as we have seen, exceedingly small, so small that the investigation
of its properties is a matter of considerable difficulty; there
are, however, many ways by which the electrical conductivity
of a gas can be increased so greatly that the investigation
becomes comparatively easy. Among such methods are raising
the temperature of the gas above a certain point. Gases drawn
from the neighbourhood of flames, electric arcs and sparks, or
glowing pieces of metal or carbon are conductors, as are also
gases through which Röntgen or cathode rays or rays of positive
electricity are passing; the rays from the radioactive metals,
radium, thorium, polonium and actinium, produce the same
effect, as does also ultra-violet light of exceedingly short wave-length.
The gas, after being made a conductor of electricity
by any of these means, is found to possess certain properties;
thus it retains its conductivity for some little time after the agent
which made it a conductor has ceased to act, though the conductivity
diminishes very rapidly and finally gets too small
to be appreciable.</p>

<p>This and several other properties of conducting gas may
readily be proved by the aid of the apparatus represented in fig. 5.
V is a testing vessel in which an electroscope is placed. Two tubes
A and C are fitted into the vessel, A being connected with a water
pump, while the far end of C is in the region where the gas is
exposed to the agent which makes it a conductor of electricity.
Let us suppose that the gas is made conducting by Röntgen rays
produced by a vacuum tube which is placed in a box, covered
except for a window at B with lead so as to protect the electroscope
from the direct action of the rays. If a slow current of air
is drawn by the water pump through the testing vessel, the charge
on the electroscope will gradually leak away. The leak, however,
ceases when the current of air is stopped. This result shows that
the gas retains its conductivity during the time taken by it to pass
from one end to the other of the tube C.</p>

<p>The gas loses its conductivity when filtered through a plug of
glass-wool, or when it is made to bubble through water. This
can readily be proved by inserting in the tube C a plug of glass-wool
or a water trap; then if by working the pump a little
harder the same current of air is produced as before, it will be
found that the electroscope will now retain its charge, showing
that the conductivity can, as it were, be filtered out of the gas.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page866" id="page866"></a>866</span>
The conductivity can also be removed from the gas by making
the gas traverse a strong electric field. We can show this by
replacing the tube C by a metal tube with an insulated wire
passing down the axis of the tube. If there is no potential
difference between the wire and the tube then the electroscope
will leak when a current of air is drawn through the vessel, but
the leak will stop if a considerable difference of potential is
maintained between the wire and the tube: this shows that a
strong electric field removes the conductivity from the gas.</p>

<p>The fact that the conductivity of the gas is removed by
filtering shows that it is due to something mixed with the gas
which is removed from it by filtration, and since the conductivity
is also removed by an electric field, the cause of the conductivity
must be charged with electricity so as to be driven to the sides
of the tube by the electric force. Since the gas as a whole is not
electrified either positively or negatively, there must be both
negative and positive charges in the gas, the amount of electricity
of one sign being equal to that of the other. We are thus led to
the conclusion that the conductivity of the gas is due to electrified
particles being mixed up with the gas, some of these particles
having charges of positive electricity, others of negative. These
electrified particles are called <i>ions</i>, and the process by which the
gas is made a conductor is called the ionization of the gas. We
shall show later that the charges and masses of the ions can be
determined, and that the gaseous ions are not identical with
those met with in the electrolysis of solutions.</p>

<p>One very characteristic property of conduction of electricity
through a gas is the relation between the current through the
gas and the electric force which gave rise to it. This relation
is not in general that expressed by Ohm&rsquo;s law, which always,
as far as our present knowledge extends, expresses the relation
for conduction through metals and electrolytes. With gases, on
the other hand, it is only when the current is very small that
Ohm&rsquo;s law is true. If we represent graphically by means of a
curve the relation between the current passing between two
parallel metal plates separated by ionized gas and the difference
of potential between the plates, the curve is of the character
shown in fig. 6 when the ordinates represent the current and
the abscissae the difference of potential between the plates.
We see that when the potential difference is very small, <i>i.e.</i>
close to the origin, the curve is approximately straight, but that
soon the current increases much
less rapidly than the potential
difference, and that a stage is
reached when no appreciable
increase of current is produced
when the potential difference is
increased; when this stage is
reached the current is constant,
and this value of the current is
called the &ldquo;saturation&rdquo; value.
When the potential difference
approaches the value at which
sparks would pass through the
gas, the current again increases with the potential difference;
thus the curve representing the relation between the current
and potential difference over very wide ranges of potential
difference has the shape shown in fig. 7; curves of this kind
have been obtained by von Schweidler (<i>Wien. Ber.</i>, 1899,
108, p. 273), and J. E. S. Townsend (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1901 [6], 1,
p. 198). We shall discuss later the causes of the rise in the
current with large potential differences, when we consider
ionization by collision.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The general features of the earlier part of the curve are readily
explained on the ionization hypothesis. On this view the Röntgen
rays or other ionizing agent acting on the gas between the plates,
produces positive and negative ions at a definite rate. Let us suppose
that q positive and q negative ions are by this means produced
per second between the plates; these under the electric force will
tend to move, the positive ones to the negative plate, the negative
ones to the positive. Some of these ions will reach the plate, others
before reaching the plate will get so near one of the opposite sign that
the attraction between them will cause them to unite and form an
electrically neutral system; when they do this they end their
existence as ions. The current between the plates is proportional
to the number of ions which reach the plates per second. Now it is
evident that we cannot go on taking more ions out of the gas than
are produced; thus we cannot, when the current is steady, have
more than q positive ions driven to the negative plate per second,
and the same number of negative ions to the positive. If each of the
positive ions carries a charge of e units of positive electricity, and
if there is an equal and opposite charge on each negative ion, then
the maximum amount of electricity which can be given to the plates
per second is qe, and this is equal to the saturation current. Thus
if we measure the saturation current, we get a direct measure of the
ionization, and this does not require us to know the value of any
quantity except the constant charge on the ion. If we attempted
to deduce the amount of ionization by measurements of the current
before it was saturated, we should require to know in addition the
velocity with which the ions move under a given electric force, the
time that elapses between the liberation of an ion and its combination
with one of the opposite sign, and the potential difference
between the plates. Thus if we wish to measure the amount of
ionization in a gas we should be careful to see that the current is
saturated.</p>

<p>The difference between conduction through gases and through
metals is shown in a striking way when we use potential differences
large enough to produce the saturation current. Suppose we
have got a potential difference between the plates more than
sufficient to produce the saturation current, and let us increase
the distance between the plates. If the gas were to act like a
metallic conductor this would diminish the current, because the
greater length would involve a greater resistance in the circuit.
In the case we are considering the separation of the plates will
<i>increase</i> the current, because now there is a larger volume of gas
exposed to the rays; there are therefore more ions produced,
and as the saturation current is proportional to the number of
ions the saturation current is increased. If the potential difference
between the plates were much less than that required to
saturate the current, then increasing the distance would diminish
the current; the gas for such potential differences obeys Ohm&rsquo;s
law and the behaviour of the gaseous resistance is therefore
similar to that of a metallic one.</p>

<p>In order to produce the saturation current the electric field
must be strong enough to drive each ion to the electrode before
it has time to enter into combination with one of the opposite
sign. Thus when the plates in the preceding example are far
apart, it will take a larger potential difference to produce this
current than when the plates are close together. The potential
difference required to saturate the current will increase as the
square of the distance between the plates, for if the ions are to
be delivered in a given time to the plates their speed must be
proportional to the distance between the plates. But the speed
is proportional to the electric force acting on the ion; hence the
electric force must be proportional to the distance between the
plates, and as in a uniform field the potential difference is equal
to the electric force multiplied by the distance between the plates,
the potential difference will vary as the square of this distance.</p>

<p>The potential difference required to produce saturation will,
other circumstances being the same, increase with the amount
of ionization, for when the number of ions is large and they are
crowded together, the time which will elapse before a positive
one combines with a negative will be smaller than when the
number of ions is small. The ions have therefore to be removed
more quickly from the gas when the ionization is great than
when it is small; thus they must move at a higher speed and
must therefore be acted upon by a larger force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page867" id="page867"></a>867</span></p>

<p>When the ions are not removed from the gas, they will increase
until the number of ions of one sign which combine with ions
of the opposite sign in any time is equal to the number produced
by the ionizing agent in that time. We can easily calculate the
number of free ions at any time after the ionizing agent has
commenced to act.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Let q be the number of ions (positive or negative) produced in
one cubic centimetre of the gas per second by the ionizing agent,
n<span class="su">1</span>, n<span class="su">2</span>, the number of free positive and negative ions respectively per
cubic centimetre of the gas. The number of collisions between
positive and negative ions per second in one cubic centimetre of the
gas is proportional to n<span class="su">1</span>n<span class="su">2</span>. If a certain fraction of the collisions
between the positive and negative ions result in the formation of an
electrically neutral system, the number of ions which disappear per
second on a cubic centimetre will be equal to &alpha;n<span class="su">1</span> n<span class="su">2</span>, where &alpha; is a
quantity which is independent of n<span class="su">1</span>, n<span class="su">2</span>; hence if t is the time since
the ionizing agent was applied to the gas, we have</p>

<p class="center1">dn<span class="su">1</span>/dt = q &minus; &alpha;n<span class="su">1</span> n<span class="su">2</span>, dn<span class="su">2</span>/dt = q &minus; &alpha;n<span class="su">1</span> n<span class="su">2</span>.</p>

<p class="noind">Thus n<span class="su">1</span> &minus; n<span class="su">2</span> is constant, so if the gas is uncharged to begin with, n<span class="su">1</span>
will always equal n<span class="su">2</span>. Putting n<span class="su">1</span> = n<span class="su">2</span> = n we have</p>

<p class="center1">dn/dt = q &minus; &alpha;n<span class="sp">2</span>&emsp;&emsp;(1),</p>

<p class="noind">if k<span class="sp">2</span> = q/&alpha;. Now the number of ions when the gas has reached a
steady state is got by putting t equal to infinity in the preceding
equation, and is therefore given by the equation</p>

<p class="center1">n<span class="su">0</span> = k = &radic; (q/&alpha;).</p>

<p class="noind">We see from equation (1) that the gas will not approximate to its
steady state until 2k&alpha;t is large, that is until t is large compared with
½k&alpha; or with ½&radic; (q&alpha;). We may thus take ½&radic; (q&alpha;) as a measure of
the time taken by the gas to reach a steady state when exposed to
an ionizing agent; as this time varies inversely as &radic;q we see that
when the ionization is feeble it may take a very considerable time for
the gas to reach a steady state. Thus in the case of our atmosphere
where the production of ions is only at the rate of about 30 per cubic
centimetre per second, and where, as we shall see, &alpha; is about 10<span class="sp">-6</span>,
it would take some minutes for the ionization in the air to get into
a steady state if the ionizing agent were suddenly applied.</p>

<p>We may use equation (1) to determine the rate at which the ions
disappear when the ionizing agent is removed. Putting q=0 in
that equation we get dn/&alpha;t = -&alpha;n<span class="sp">2</span>.</p>

<p class="noind">Hence</p>

<p class="center1">n = n<span class="su">0</span>/(1 + n<span class="su">0</span> &alpha;t)&emsp;&emsp;(3),</p>

<p class="noind">where n<span class="su">0</span> is the number of ions when t = 0. Thus the number of ions
falls to one-half its initial value in the time 1/n<span class="su">0</span>&alpha;. The quantity &alpha; is
called the <i>coefficient of recombination</i>, and its value for different gases
has been determined by Rutherford (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> 1897 [5], 44, p. 422),
Townsend (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1900, 193, p. 129), McClung (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>,

Retschinsky (<i>Ann. d. Phys.</i>, 1905, 17, p. 518), Hendred (<i>Phys. Rev.</i>,
1905, 21, p. 314). The values of &alpha;/e, e being the charge on an ion in
electrostatic measure as determined by these observers for different
gases, is given in the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">The gases in these experiments were carefully dried and free from
dust; the apparent value of &alpha; is much increased when dust or small
drops of water are present in the gas, for then the ions get caught
by the dust particles, the mass of a particle is so great compared
with that of an ion that they are practically immovable under the
action of the electric field, and so the ions clinging to them escape
detection when electrical methods are used. Taking e as 3.5&times;10<span class="sp">-10</span>,
we see that &alpha; is about 1.2&times;10<span class="sp">-6</span>, so that the number of recombinations
in unit time between n positive and n negative ions in unit
volume is 1.2&times;10<span class="sp">-6</span>n<span class="sp">2</span>. The kinetic theory of gases shows that
if we have n molecules of air per cubic centimetre, the number of
collisions per second is 1.2&times;10<span class="sp">-10</span>n<span class="sp">2</span> at a temperature of 0° C. Thus
we see that the number of recombinations between oppositely
charged ions is enormously greater than the number of collisions
between the same number of neutral molecules. We shall see that
the difference in size between the ion and the molecule is not nearly
sufficient to account for the difference between the collisions in the
two cases; the difference is due to the force between the oppositely
charged ions, which drags ions into collisions which but for this force
would have missed each other.</p>

<p>Several methods have been used to measure &alpha;. In one method
air, exposed to some ionizing agent at one end of a long tube, is
slowly sucked through the tube and the saturation current measured
at different points along the tube. These currents are proportional
to the values of n at the place of observation: if we know the
distance of this place from the end of the tube when the gas was
ionized and the velocity of the stream of gas, we can find t in equation
(3), and knowing the value of n we can deduce the value of &alpha; from
the equation</p>

<p class="center1">1/n<span class="su">1</span> &minus; 1/n<span class="su">2</span> = &alpha;(t<span class="su">1</span> &minus; t<span class="su">2</span>),</p>

<p class="noind">where n<span class="su">1</span>, n<span class="su">2</span> are the values of n at the times t<span class="su">1</span>, t<span class="su">2</span> respectively. In this
method the tubes ought to be so wide that the loss of ions by diffusion
to the sides of the tube is negligible. There are other methods which
involve the knowledge of the speed with which the ions move under
the action of known electric forces; we shall defer the consideration
of these methods until we have discussed the question of these
speeds.</p>

<p>In measuring the value of &alpha; it should be remembered that the
theory of the methods supposes that the ionization is uniform
throughout the gas. If the total ionization throughout a gas remains
constant, but instead of being uniformly distributed is concentrated
in patches, it is evident that the ions will recombine more quickly
in the second case than in the first, and that the value of &alpha; will be
different in the two cases. This probably explains the large values
of &alpha; obtained by Retschinsky, who ionized the gas by the &alpha; rays
from radium, a method which produces very patchy ionization.</p>

<p><i>Variation of &alpha; with the Pressure of the Gas.</i>&mdash;All observers agree
that there is little variation in &alpha; with the pressures for pressures of
between 5 and 1 atmospheres; at lower pressures, however, the
value of &alpha; seems to diminish with the pressure: thus Langevin
(<i>Ann. chim. phys.</i>, 1903, 28, p. 287) found that at a pressure of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>
of an atmosphere the value of &alpha; was about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> of its value at
atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p><i>Variation of &alpha; with the Temperature.</i>&mdash;Erikson (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, Aug.
1909) has shown that the value of &alpha; for air increases as the temperature
diminishes, and that at the temperature of liquid air -180° C.,
it is more than twice as great as at +12° C.</p>

<p>Since, as we have seen, the recombination is due to the coming
together of the positive and negative ions under the influence of the
electrical attraction between them, it follows that a large electric
force sufficient to overcome this attraction would keep the ions apart
and hence diminish the coefficient of recombination. Simple considerations,
however, will show that it would require exceedingly
strong electric fields to produce an appreciable effect. The value of
&alpha; indicates that for two oppositely charged ions to unite they must
come within a distance of about 1.5&times;10<span class="sp">-6</span> centimetres; at this
distance the attraction between them is e<span class="sp">2</span>&times;10<span class="sp">12</span>/2.25, and if X is the
external electric force, the force tending to pull them apart cannot
be greater than Xe; if this is to be comparable with the attraction,
X must be comparable with e&times;10<span class="sp">12</span>/2.25, or putting e = 4&times;10<span class="sp">-10</span>,
with 1.8&times;10<span class="sp">2</span>; this is 54,000 volts per centimetre, a force which
could not be applied to gas at atmospheric pressure without producing
a spark.</p>

<p><i>Diffusion of the Ions.</i>&mdash;The ionized gas acts like a mixture of gases,
the ions corresponding to two different gases, the non-ionized gas
to a third. If the concentration of the ions is not uniform, they will
diffuse through the non-ionized gas in such a way as to produce a
more uniform distribution. A very valuable series of determinations
of the coefficient of diffusion of ions through various gases has been
made by Townsend (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1900, A, 193, p. 129). The method
used was to suck the ionized gas through narrow tubes; by measuring
the loss of both the positive and negative ions after the gases
had passed through a known length of tube, and allowing for the loss
by recombination, the loss by diffusion and hence the coefficient of
diffusion could be determined. The following tables give the values
of the coefficients of diffusion D on the C.G.S. system of units as
determined by Townsend:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">It is interesting to compare with these coefficients the values of D
when various gases diffuse through each other. D for hydrogen
through air is .634, for oxygen through air .177, for the vapour of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page868" id="page868"></a>868</span>
isobutyl amide through air .042. We thus see that the velocity
of diffusion of ions through air is much less than that of the simple
gas, but that it is quite comparable with that of the vapours of some
complex organic compounds.</p>

<p>The preceding tables show that the negative ions diffuse more
rapidly than the positive, especially in dry gases. The superior
mobility of the negative ions was observed first by Zeleny (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>,
1898 [5], 46, p. 120), who showed that the velocity of the negative
ions under an electric force is greater than that of the positive. It
will be noticed that the difference between the mobility of the
negative and the positive ions is much more pronounced in dry
gases than in moist. The difference in the rates of diffusion of the
positive and negative ions is the reason why ionized gas, in which,
to begin with, the positive and negative charges were of equal
amounts, sometimes becomes electrified even although the gas is not
acted upon by electric forces. Thus, for example, if such gas be
blown through narrow tubes, it will be positively electrified when
it comes out, for since the negative ions diffuse more rapidly than
the positive, the gas in its passage through the tubes will lose by
diffusion more negative than positive ions and hence will emerge
positively electrified. Zeleny snowed that this effect does not occur
when, as in carbonic acid gas, the positive and negative ions diffuse
at the same rates. Townsend (loc. cit.) showed that the coefficient
of diffusion of the ions is the same whether the ionization is produced
by Röntgen rays, radioactive substances, ultra-violet light, or
electric sparks. The ions produced by chemical reactions and in
flames are much less mobile; thus, for example, Bloch (<i>Ann. chim.
phys.</i>, 1905 [8], 4, p. 25) found that for the ions produced by drawing
air over phosphorus the value of &alpha;/e was between 1 and 6 instead
of over 3000, the value when the air was ionized by Röntgen rays.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Velocity of Ions in an Electric Field.</i>&mdash;The velocity of ions in an
electric field, which is of fundamental importance in conduction,
is very closely related to the coefficient of diffusion. Measurements
of this velocity for ions produced by Röntgen rays have
been made by Rutherford (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [5], 44, p. 422), Zeleny
(<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [5], 46, p. 120), Langevin (<i>Ann. Chim. Phys.</i>, 1903,
28, p. 289), Phillips (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> 78, A, p. 167), and Wellisch
(<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1909, 209, p. 249). The ions produced by radioactive
substance have been investigated by Rutherford (<i>Phil.
Mag.</i> [5], 47, p. 109) and by Franck and Pohl (<i>Verh. deutsch. phys.
Gesell.</i>, 1907, 9, p. 69), and the negative ions produced when ultra-violet
light falls on a metal plate by Rutherford (<i>Proc. Camb. Phil.
Soc.</i> 9, p. 401). H. A. Wilson (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> 192, p. 4O9), Marx (<i>Ann.
de Phys.</i> 11, p. 765), Moreau (<i>Journ. de Phys.</i> 4, 11, p. 558; <i>Ann.
Chim. Phys.</i> 7, 30, p. 5) and Gold (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> 79, p. 43) have
investigated the velocities of ions produced by putting various
salts into flames; McClelland (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> 46, p. 29) the velocity
of the ions in gases sucked from the neighbourhood of flames and
arcs; Townsend (<i>Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.</i> 9, p. 345) and Bloch
(<i>loc. cit.</i>) the velocity of ions produced by chemical reaction; and
Chattock (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [5], 48, p. 401) the velocity of the ions produced
when electricity escapes from a sharp needle point into a gas.</p>

<p>Several methods have been employed to determine these
velocities. The one most frequently employed is to find the
electromotive intensity required to force an ion against the
stream of gas moving with a known velocity parallel to the lines
of electric force. Thus, of two perforated plane electrodes
vertically over each other, suppose the lower to be positively,
the upper negatively electrified, and suppose that the gas is
streaming vertically downwards with the velocity V; then unless
the upward velocity of the positive ion is greater than V, no
positive electricity will reach the upper plate. If we increase
the strength of the field between the plates, and hence the upward
velocity of the positive ion, until the positive ions just begin to
reach the upper plate, we know that with this strength of field the
velocity of the positive ion is equal to V. By this method, which
has been used by Rutherford, Zeleny and H. A. Wilson, the
velocity of ions in fields of various strengths has been determined.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The arrangement used by Zeleny is represented in fig. 8. P and
Q are square brass plates. They are bored through their centres,
and to the openings the tubes R and S are attached, the space
between the plates being covered in so as to form a closed box.
K is a piece of wire gauze completely covering the opening in Q;
T is an insulated piece of wire gauze nearly but not quite filling the
opening in the plate P, and connected with one pair of quadrants of an
electrometer E. A plug of glass wool G filters out the dust from a
stream of gas which enters the vessel by the tube D and leaves it by
F; this plug also makes the velocity of the flow of the gas uniform
across the section of the tube. The Röntgen rays to ionize the gas
were produced by a bulb at O, the bulb and coil being in a lead-covered
box, with an aluminium window through which the rays
passed. Q is connected with one pole of a battery of cells, P and the
other pole of the battery are put to earth. The changes in the
potential of T are due to ions giving up their charges to it. With a
given velocity of air-blast the potential of T was found not to change
unless the difference of potential between P and Q exceeded a critical
value. The field corresponding to this critical value thus made the
ions move with the known velocity of the blast.</p>

<p>Another method which has been employed by Rutherford and
McClelland is based on the action of an electric field in destroying
the conductivity of gas streaming through it. Suppose that BAB,
DCD (fig. 9) are a system of parallel plates boxed in so that a stream
of gas, after flowing between BB, passes between DD without any
loss of gas in the interval. Suppose the plates DD are insulated, and
connected with one pair of quadrants of an electrometer, by charging
up C to a sufficiently high potential we can drive all the positive
ions which enter the system DCD against the plates D; this will
cause a deflexion of the electrometer, which in one second will be
proportional to the number of positive ions which have entered the
system in that time. If we charge A up to a high potential, B being
put to earth, we shall find
that the deflexion of the electrometer
connected with
DD is less than it was when
A and B were at the same
potential, because some of
the positive ions in their
passage through BAB are driven against the plates B. If u is the
velocity along the lines of force in the uniform electric field between
A and B, and t the time it takes for the gas to pass through BAB, then
all the positive ions within a distance ut of the plates B will be driven
up against these plates, and thus if the positive ions are equally distributed
through the gas, the number of positive ions which emerge
from the system when the electric field is on will bear to the number
which emerge when the field is off the ratio of 1 &minus; ut/l to unity, where
l is the distance between A and B. This ratio is equal to the ratio of
the deflexions in one second of the electrometer attached to D, hence
the observations of this instrument give 1 &minus; ut/l. If we know the
velocity of the gas and the length of the plates A and B, we can
determine t, and since l can be easily measured, we can find u, the
velocity of the positive ion in a field of given strength. By charging
A and C negatively instead of positively we can arrive at the
velocity of the negative ion. In practice it is more convenient to use
cylindrical tubes with coaxial wires instead of the systems of parallel
plates, though in this case the calculation of the velocity of the ions
from the observations is a little more complicated, inasmuch as the
electric field is not uniform between the tubes.</p>

<p>A method which gives very accurate results, though it is only
applicable in certain cases, is the one used by Rutherford to measure
the velocity of the negative ions produced close to a metal plate by
the incidence on the plate of ultra-violet light. The principle of the
method is as follows:&mdash;AB (fig. 10) is an insulated horizontal plate
of well-polished zinc, which can be
moved vertically up and down by
means of a screw; it is connected with
one pair of quadrants of an electrometer,
the other pair of quadrants being
put to earth. CD is a base-plate with a
hole EF in it; this hole is covered with
fine wire gauze, through which ultra-violet
light passes and falls on the plate
AB. The plate CD is connected with
an alternating current dynamo, which
produces a simply-periodic potential
difference between AB and CD, the other pole being put to earth.
Suppose that at any instant the plate CD is at a higher potential than
AB, then the negative ions from AB will move towards CD, and will
continue to do so as long as the potential of CD is higher than that of
AB. If, however, the potential difference changes sign before the negative
ions reach CD, these ions will go back to AB. Thus AB will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page869" id="page869"></a>869</span>
lose any negative charge unless the distance between the plates AB and
CD is less than the distance traversed by the negative ion during the
time the potential of CD is higher than that of AB. By altering the
distance between the plates until CD just begins to lose a negative
charge, we find the velocity of the negative ion under unit electromotive
intensity. For suppose the difference of potential between
AB and CD is equal to a sin pt, then if d is the distance between the
plates, the electric intensity is equal to a sin pt/d; if we suppose the
velocity of the ion is proportional to the electric intensity, and if u
is the velocity for unit electric intensity, the velocity of the negative
ion will be ua sin pt/d. Hence if x represent the distance of the ion
from AB</p>

<tr> <td class="denom">pd</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Thus the greatest distance the ion can get from the plate is equal
to 2au/pd, and if the distance between the plates is gradually reduced
to this value, the plate AB will begin to lose a negative charge; hence
when this happens</p>

<p class="center1">d = 2au/pd, &emsp;or u = pd<span class="sp">2</span>/2a,</p>

<p class="noind">an equation by means of which we can find u.</p>

<p>In this form the method is not applicable when ions of both signs
are present. Franck and Pohl (<i>Verh. deutsch. physik. Gesell.</i> 1907,
9, p. 69) have by a slight modification removed this restriction.
The modification consists in confining the ionization to a layer of gas
below the gauze EF. If the velocity of the positive ions is to be
determined, these ions are forced through the gauze by applying
to the ionized gas a small constant electric force acting upwards;
if negative ions are required, the constant force is reversed. After
passing through the gauze the ions are acted upon by alternating
forces as in Rutherford&rsquo;s method.</p>

<p>Langevin (<i>Ann. chim. phys.</i>, 1903, 28, p. 289) devised a method
of measuring the velocity of the ions which has been extensively
used; it has the advantage of not requiring the rate of ionization
to remain uniform. The general idea is as follows. Suppose that
we expose the gas between two parallel plates A, B to Röntgen rays
or some other ionizing agent, then stop the rays and apply a uniform
electric field to the region between the plates. If the force on the
positive ion is from A to B, the plate B will receive a positive charge
of electricity. After the electric force has acted for a time T reverse
it. B will now begin to receive negative electricity and will go on
doing so until the supply of negative ions is exhausted. Let us
consider how the quantity of positive electricity received by B will
vary with T. To fix our ideas, suppose the positive ions move more
slowly than the negative; let T<span class="su">2</span> and T<span class="su">1</span> be respectively the times
taken by the positive and negative ions to move under the electric
field through a distance equal to AB, the distance between the
planes. Then if T is greater than T<span class="su">2</span> all the ions will have been
driven from between the plates before the field is reversed, and therefore
the positive charge received by B will not depend upon T.
Next let T be less than T<span class="su">2</span> but greater than T<span class="su">1</span>; then at the time
when the field is reversed all the negative ions will have been driven
from between the plates, so that the positive charge received by B
will not be neutralized by the arrival of fresh ions coming to it after
the reversal of the field. The number of positive ions driven against
the plate B will be proportional to T. Thus if we measure the value
of the positive charge on B for a series of values of T, each value being
less than the preceding, we shall find that until T reaches a certain
value the charge remains constant, but as soon as we reduce the
time below this value the charge diminishes. The value of T when
the diminution in the field begins is T<span class="su">2</span>, the time taken for a positive
ion to cross from A to B under the electric field; thus from T<span class="su">2</span> we
can calculate the velocity of the positive ion in this field. If we still
further diminish T, we shall find that we reach a value when the
diminution of the positive charge on B with the time suddenly
becomes much more rapid; this change occurs when T falls below T<span class="su">1</span>
the time taken for the negative ions to go from one plate to the other,
for now when the field is reversed there are still some negative ions
left between the plates, and these will be driven against B and rob it
of some of the positive charge it had acquired before the field was
reversed. By observing the time when the increase in the rate of
diminution of the positive charge with the time suddenly sets in
we can determine T<span class="su">1</span>, and hence the velocity of the negative ions.</p>

<p>The velocity of the ions produced by the discharge of electricity
from a fine point was determined by Chattock by an entirely different
method. In this case the electric field is so strong and the velocity
of the ion so great that the preceding methods are not applicable.
Suppose P represents a vertical needle discharging electricity into
air, consider the force acting on the ions included between two
horizontal planes A, B. If P is the density of the electrification,
and Z the vertical component of the electric intensity, F the resultant
force on the ions between A and B is vertical and equal to</p>

<p class="center1"><span class="f150">&int;&int;&int;</span> Z&rho; dxdydz.</p>

<p class="noind">Let us suppose that the velocity of the ion is proportional to the
electric intensity, so that if w is the vertical velocity of the ions,
which are supposed all to be of one sign, w = RZ.</p>

<p>Substituting this value of Z, the vertical force on the ions between
A and B is equal to</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td>1</td> <td rowspan="2"><span class="f150">&int;&int;&int;</span> w&rho; dxdydz.</td></tr>
<tr> <td class="denom">R</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">But &int;&int; w&rho;dxdy = &iota;, where &iota; is the current streaming from the point.
This current, which can be easily measured by putting a galvanometer
in series with the discharging point, is independent of z,
the vertical distance of a plane between A and B below the charging
point. Hence we have</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr> <td rowspan="2">F =</td>  <td>&iota;</td> <td rowspan="2"><span class="f150">&int;</span>dz &emsp;=</td>
     <td>&iota;</td> <td rowspan="2"> · z.</td></tr>
<tr> <td class="denom">R</td> <td class="denom">R</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">This force must be counterbalanced by the difference of gaseous
pressures over the planes A and B; hence if p<span class="su">B</span> and p<span class="su">A</span> denote
respectively the pressures over B and A, we have</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr> <td rowspan="2">p<span class="su">B</span> &minus; p<span class="su">A</span> =</td> <td>&iota;</td>
     <td rowspan="2">z.</td></tr>
<tr> <td class="denom">R</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Hence by the measurement of these pressures we can determine
R, and hence the velocity with which an ion moves under a given
electric intensity.</p>

<p>There are other methods of determining the velocities of the
ions, but as these depend on the theory of the conduction of electricity
through a gas containing charged ions, we shall consider them in our
discussion of that theory.</p>

<p>By the use of these methods it has been shown that the velocities
of the ions in a given gas are the same whether the ionization is
produced by Röntgen rays, radioactive substances, ultra-violet
light, or by the discharge of electricity from points. When the
ionization is produced by chemical action the ions are very much
less mobile, moving in the same electric field with a velocity less
than one-thousandth part of the velocity of the first kind of ions.
On the other hand, as we shall see later, the velocity of the negative
ions in flames is enormously greater than that of even the first kind
of ion under similar electric fields and at the same pressure. But
when these negative ions get into the cold part of the flame, they
move sluggishly with velocities of the order of those possessed by
the second kind. The results of the various determinations of the
velocities of the ions are given in the following table. The velocities
are in centimetres per second under an electric force of one volt per
centimetre, the pressure of the gas being 1 atmosphere. V+
denotes the velocity of the positive ion, V- that of the negative.
V is the mean velocity of the positive and negative ions.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this table that the greater mobility of the
negative ions is very much more marked in the case of the lighter
and simpler gases than in that of the heavier and more complicated
ones; with the vapours of organic substances there seems but little
difference between the mobilities of the positive and negative ions,
indeed in one or two cases the positive one seems slightly but very
slightly the more mobile of the two. In the case of the simple gases
the difference is much greater when the gases are dry than when they
are moist. It has been shown by direct experiment that the velocities
are directly proportional to the electric force.</p>

<p><i>Variation of Velocities with Pressure.</i>&mdash;Until the pressure gets low
the velocities of the ions, negative as well as positive, vary inversely
as the pressure. Langevin (loc. cit.) was the first to show that at very
low pressures the velocity of the negative ions increases more
rapidly as the pressure is diminished than this law indicates. If the
nature of the ion did not change with the pressure, the kinetic theory
of gases indicates that the velocity would vary inversely as the
pressure, so that Langevin&rsquo;s results indicate a change in the nature
of the negative ion when the pressure is diminished below a certain
value. Langevin&rsquo;s results are given in the following table, where p
represents the pressure measured in centimetres of mercury, V+ and
V- the velocities of the positive and negative ions in air under
unit electrostatic force, <i>i.e.</i> 300 volts per centimetre:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">The increase in the case of pV- indicates that the structure of the
negative ion gets simpler as the pressure is reduced. Wallisch in
some experiments made at the Cavendish Laboratory found that the
diminution in the value of pV- at low pressures is much more marked
in some gases than in others, and in some gases he failed to detect
it; but it must be remembered that it is difficult to get measurements
at pressures of only a few millimetres, as the amount of ionization
is so exceedingly small at such pressures that the quantities to be
observed are hardly large enough to admit of accurate measurements
by the methods available at higher pressures.</p>

<p>We see that except in the case of the lowest temperature, that of
liquid air, where there is a great drop in the velocity, the velocities
of the ions are proportional to the absolute temperature. On the
hypothesis of an ion of constant size we should, from the kinetic
theory of gases, expect the velocity to be proportional to the square
root of the absolute temperature, if the charge on the ion did not
affect the number of collisions between the ion and the molecules of
the gas through which it is moving. If the collisions were brought
about by the electrical attraction between the ions and the molecules,
the velocity would be proportional to the absolute temperature.
H. A. Wilson (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> 192, p. 499), in his experiments on the
conduction of flames and hot gases into which salts had been put,
found that the velocity of the positive ions in flames at a temperature
of 2000° C. containing the salts of the alkali metals was 62 cm./sec.
under an electric force of one volt per centimetre, while the velocity
of the positive ions in a stream of hot air at 1000° C. containing the
same salts was only 7 cm./sec. under the same force. The great effect
of temperature is also shown in some experiments of McClelland
(<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [5], 46, p. 29) on the velocities of the ions in gases drawn
from Bunsen flames and arcs; he found that these depended upon
the distance the gas had travelled from the flame. Thus, the velocity
of the ions at a distance of 5.5 cm. from the Bunsen flame when the
temperature was 230° C. was .23 cm./sec. for a volt per centimetre;
at a distance of 10 cm. from the flame when the temperature was
160° C. the velocity was .21 cm./sec; while at a distance of 14.5
cm. from the flame when the temperature was 105° C. the velocity
was only .04 cm./sec. If the temperature of the gas at this distance
from the flame was raised by external means, the velocity of the ions
increased.</p>

<p>We can derive some information as to the constitution of the
ions by calculating the velocity with which a molecule of the gas
would move in the electric field if it carried the same charge as the
ion. From the theory of the diffusion of gases, as developed by
Maxwell, we know that if the particles of a gas A are surrounded
by a gas B, then, if the partial pressure of A is small, the velocity u
with which its particles will move when acted upon by a force Xe
is given by the equation</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr> <td rowspan="2">u =</td> <td>Xe</td>  <td rowspan="2">D,</td></tr>
<tr> <td class="denom">(p<span class="su">1</span>/N<span class="su">1</span>)</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">where D represents the coefficient of inter-diffusion of A into B,
and N<span class="su">1</span> the number of particles of A per cubic centimetre when the
pressure due to A is p<span class="su">1</span>. Let us calculate by this equation the
velocity with which a molecule of hydrogen would move through
hydrogen if it carried the charge carried by an ion, which we shall
prove shortly to be equal to the charge carried by an atom of hydrogen
in the electrolysis of solutions. Since p<span class="su">1</span>/N<span class="su">1</span> is independent of the
pressure, it is equal to &Pi;/N, where &Pi; is the atmospheric pressure and
N the number of molecules in a cubic centimetre of gas at atmospheric
pressure. Now N<span class="su">e</span> = 1.22&times;10<span class="sp">10</span>, if e is measured in electrostatic
units; &Pi; = 10<span class="sp">6</span> and D in this case is the coefficient of diffusion
of hydrogen into itself, and is equal to 1.7. Substituting these values
we find</p>

<p class="center1">u = 1.97&times;10<span class="sp">4</span>X.</p>

<p class="noind">If the potential gradient is 1 volt per centimetre, X = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">300</span>. Substituting
this value for X, we find u = 66 cm./sec, for the velocity of
a hydrogen molecule. We have seen that the velocity of the ion in
hydrogen is only about 5 cm./sec, so that the ion moves more slowly
than it would if it were a single molecule. One way of explaining
this is to suppose that the ion is bigger than the molecule, and is
in fact an aggregation of molecules, the charged ion acting as a
nucleus around which molecules collect like dust round a charged
body. This view is supported by the effect produced by moisture in
diminishing the velocity of the negative ion, for, as C. T. R. Wilson
(<i>Phil. Trans.</i> 193, p. 289) has shown, moisture tends to collect
round the ions, and condenses more easily on the negative than on
the positive ion. In connexion with the velocities of ions in the
gases drawn from flames, we find other instances which suggest
that condensation takes place round the ions. An increase in the
size of the system is not, however, the only way by which the velocity
might fall below that calculated for the hydrogen molecule, for we
must remember that the hydrogen molecule, whose coefficient of
diffusion is 1.7, is not charged, while the ion is. The forces exerted
by the ion on the other molecules of hydrogen are not the same as
those which would be exerted by a molecule of hydrogen, and as the
coefficient of diffusion depends on the forces between the molecules,
the coefficient of diffusion of a charged molecule into hydrogen might
be very different from that of an uncharged one.</p>

<p>Wellisch (<i>loc. cit.</i>) has shown that the effect of the charge on the
ion is sufficient in many cases to explain the small velocity of the ions,
even if there were no aggregation.</p>

<p><i>Mixture of Gases.</i>&mdash;The ionization of a mixture of gases raises
some very interesting questions. If we ionize a mixture of two
very different gases, say hydrogen and carbonic acid, and investigate
the nature of the ions by  measuring their velocities, the question
arises, shall we find two kinds of positive and two kinds of negative
ions moving with different velocities, as we should do if some of the
positive ions were positively charged hydrogen molecules, while
others were positively charged molecules of carbonic acid; or shall
we find only one velocity for the positive ions and one for the negative?
Many experiments have been made on the velocity of ions
in mixtures of two gases, but as yet no evidence has been found of
the existence of two different kinds of either positive or negative
ions in such mixtures, although some of the methods for determining
the velocities of the ions, especially Langevin&rsquo;s, ought to give
evidence of this effect, if it existed. The experiments seem to show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page871" id="page871"></a>871</span>
that the positive (and the same is true for the negative) ions in a
mixture of gases are all of the same kind. This conclusion is one of
considerable importance, as it would not be true if the ions consisted
of single molecules of the gas from which they are produced.</p>

<p><i>Recombination.</i>&mdash;Several methods enable us to deduce the coefficient
of recombination of the ions when we know their velocities.
Perhaps the simplest of these consists in determining the relation
between the current passing between two parallel plates immersed
in ionized gas and the potential difference between the plates. For
let q be the amount of ionization, <i>i.e.</i> the number of ions produced
per second per unit volume of the gas, A the area of one of the plates,
and d the distance between them; then if the ionization is constant
through the volume, the number of ions of one sign produced per
second in the gas is qAd. Now if i is the current per unit area of
the plate, e the charge on an ion, iA/e ions of each sign are driven
out of the gas by the current per second. In addition to this source
of loss of ions there is the loss due to the recombination; if n is the
number of positive or negative ions per unit volume, then the
number which recombine per second is &alpha;n<span class="sp">2</span> per cubic centimetre,
and if n is constant through the volume of the gas, as will approximately
be the case if the current through the gas is only a small
fraction of the saturation current, the number of ions which disappear
per second through recombination is &alpha;n<span class="sp">2</span>·Ad. Hence, since when
the gas is in a steady state the number of ions produced must be
equal to the number which disappear, we have</p>

<p class="center1">qAd = iA/e + &alpha;n<span class="sp">2</span>·Ad,<br />
q = i/ed + &alpha;n<span class="sp">2</span>.</p>

<p class="noind">If u<span class="su">1</span> and u<span class="su">2</span> are the velocities with which the positive and negative
ions move, nu<span class="su">1</span>e and nu<span class="su">2</span>e are respectively the quantities of positive
electricity passing in one direction through unit area of the gas per
second, and of negative in the opposite direction, hence</p>

<p class="center1">i = nu<span class="su">1</span>e + nu<span class="su">2</span>e.</p>

<p class="noind">If X is the electric force acting on the gas, k<span class="su">1</span> and k<span class="su">2</span> the velocities
of the positive and negative ions under unit force, u<span class="su">1</span> = k<span class="su">1</span>X,
u<span class="su">2</span> = k<span class="su">2</span>X; hence</p>

<p class="center1">n = i/(k<span class="su">1</span> + k<span class="su">2</span>)Xe,</p>

<p class="noind">and we have</p>

<p class="noind">Hence if we determine corresponding values of X and i we can
deduce the value of &alpha;/e if we also know (k<span class="su">1</span> + k<span class="su">2</span>). The value of I
is easily determined, as it is the current when X is very large. The
preceding result only applies when i is small compared with I,
as it is only in this case that the values of n and X are uniform
throughout the volume of the gas. Another method which answers
the same purpose is due to Langevin (<i>Ann. Chim. Phys.</i>, 1903, 28,
p. 289); it is as follows. Let A and B be two parallel planes immersed
in a gas, and let a slab of the gas bounded by the planes a, b parallel
to A and B be ionized by an instantaneous flash of Röntgen rays.
If A and B are at different electric potentials, then all the positive
ions produced by the rays will be attracted by the negative plate
and all the negative ions by the positive, if the electric field were
exceedingly large they would reach these plates before they had time
to recombine, so that each plate would receive N<span class="su">0</span> ions if the flash of
Röntgen rays produced N<span class="su">0</span> positive and N<span class="su">0</span> negative ions. With
weaker fields the number of ions received by the plates will be less
as some of them will recombine before they can reach the plates.
We can find the number of ions which reach the plates in this case
in the following way:&mdash;In consequence of the movement of the ions
the slab of ionized gas will broaden out and will consist of three
portions, one in which there are nothing but positive ions,&mdash;this is
on the side of the negative plate,&mdash;another on the side of the positive
plate in which there are nothing but negative ions, and a portion
between these in which there are both positive and negative ions;
it is in this layer that recombination takes place, and here if n is the
number of positive or negative ions at the time t after the flash of
Röntgen rays,</p>

<p class="center1">n = n<span class="su">0</span>/(1 + &alpha;n<span class="su">0</span>t).</p>

<p class="noind">With the same notation as before, the breadth of either of the outer
layers will in time dt increase by X(k<span class="su">1</span> + k<span class="su">2</span>)dt, and the number of
ions in it by X(k<span class="su">1</span> + k<span class="su">2</span>)ndt; these ions will reach the plate, the outer
layers will receive fresh ions until the middle one disappears, which
it will do after a time l/X(k<span class="su">1</span> + k<span class="su">2</span>), where l is the thickness of the
slab ab of ionized gas; hence N, the number of ions reaching either

<p><i>Distribution of Electric Force when a Current is passing through an
Ionized Gas.</i>&mdash;Let the two plates be at right angles to the axis of x;
then we may suppose that between the plates the electric intensity
X is everywhere parallel to the axis of x. The velocities of both the
positive and negative ions are assumed to be proportional to X. Let
k<span class="su">1</span>X, k<span class="su">2</span>X represent these velocities respectively; let n<span class="su">1</span>, n<span class="su">2</span> be respectively
the number of positive and negative ions per unit volume at
a point fixed by the co-ordinate x; let q be the number of positive
or negative ions produced in unit time per unit volume at this
point; and let the number of ions which recombine in unit volume
in unit time be &alpha;n<span class="su">1</span>n<span class="su">2</span>; then if e is the charge on the ion, the volume

<p class="noind">an equation which is very useful, <span class="correction" title="amended from becaus">because</span> it enables us, if we know
the distribution of X², to find whether at any point in the gas
the ionization is greater or less than the recombination of the ions.
We see that q &minus; &alpha;n<span class="su">1</span>n<span class="su">2</span>, which is the excess of ionization over recombination,
is proportional to d²X²/dx². Thus when the ionization
exceeds the recombination, <i>i.e.</i> when q &minus; &alpha;n<span class="su">1</span>n<span class="su">2</span> is positive, the curve
for X² is convex to the axis of x, while when the recombination
exceeds the ionization the curve for X² will be concave to the axis of x.
Thus, for example, fig. 11 represents the curve for X² observed by
Graham (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 64, p. 49) in a tube through which a steady
current is passing. Interpreting it by equation (7), we infer that
ionization was much in excess of recombination at A and B, slightly
so along C, while along D the recombination exceeded the ionization.

of successive approximations obtained solutions of equation (8) (i.)

(ii.) when the current is nearly saturated. The results of his investigations
are represented in fig. 12, which represents the distribution of

term will be very small outside a layer of gas next the cathode of
such thickness that the number of ions produced on it would be
sufficient, if they were all utilized for the purpose, to carry the
current; in the case of flames this layer is exceedingly thin unless
the current is very large. The value of the electric force in the
uniform part of the field is equal to i/k<span class="su">2</span>e · &radic;<span class="ov">a/q</span>, while when i<span class="su">0</span> = 0,
the force at the cathode itself bears to the uniform force the ratio of

with great rapidity as we approach the cathode; this is a very
characteristic feature of the passage of electricity through flames
and hot gases. Thus in an experiment made by H. A. Wilson with a
flame 18 cm. long, the drop of potential within 1 centimetre of the
cathode was about five times the drop in the other 17 cm. of the tube.
The relation between the current and the potential difference when

<p class="noind">The fall of potential at the cathode is proportional to the square of
the current, while the fall in the rest of the circuit is directly proportional
to the current. In the case of flames or hot gases, the fall
of potential at the cathode is much greater than that in the rest of the
circuit, so that in such cases the current through the gas varies nearly
as the square root of the potential difference. The equation we have
just obtained is of the form</p>

<p class="center1">V = Ai + Bi²,</p>

<p class="noind">and H. A. Wilson has shown that a relation of this form represents
the results of his experiments on the conduction of electricity through
flames.</p>

<p>The expression for the fall of potential at the cathode is inversely
proportional to q<span class="sp">3/2</span>, q being the number of ions produced per cubic
centimetre per second close to the cathode; thus any increase in
the ionization at the cathode will diminish the potential fall at the
cathode, and as practically the whole potential difference between
the electrodes occurs at the cathode, a diminution in the potential
fall there will be much more important than a diminution in the
electric force in the uniform part of the discharge, when the force is
comparatively insignificant. This consideration explains a very
striking phenomenon discovered many years ago by Hittorf, who
found that if he put a wire carrying a bead of a volatile salt into the
flame, it produced little effect upon the current, unless it were placed
close to the cathode where it gave rise to an enormous increase in
the current, sometimes increasing the current more than a hundredfold.
The introduction of the salt increases very largely the number
of ions produced, so that q is much greater for a salted flame than
for a plain one. Thus Hittorf&rsquo;s result coincides with the conclusions
we have drawn from the theory of this class of conduction.</p>

<p>The fall of potential at the cathode is proportional to i &minus; i<span class="su">0</span>,
where i<span class="su">0</span> is the stream of negative electricity which comes from the
cathode itself, thus as i<span class="su">0</span> increases the fall of potential at the cathode
diminishes and the current sent by a given potential difference
through the gas increases. Now all metals give out negative particles
when heated, at a rate which increases very rapidly with the temperature,
but at the same temperature some metals give out more than
others. If the cathode is made of a metal which emits large quantities
of negative particles, (i &minus; i<span class="su">0</span>) will for a given value of i be smaller
than if the metal only emitted a small number of particles; thus the
cathode fall will be smaller for the metal with the greater emissitivity,
and the relation between the potential difference and the current
will be different in the two cases. These considerations are confirmed
by experience, for it has been found that the current between
electrodes immersed in a flame depends to a great extent upon the
metal of which the electrodes are made. Thus Pettinelli (<i>Acc. dei
Lincei</i> [5], v. p. 118) found that, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, the current between
two carbon electrodes was about 500 times that between two iron
ones. If one electrode was carbon and the other iron, the current
when the carbon was cathode and the iron anode was more than
100 times the current when the electrodes were reversed. The
emission of negative particles by some metallic oxides, notably
those of calcium and barium, has been shown by Wehnelt (<i>Ann. der
Phys.</i> 11, p. 425) to be far greater than that of any known metal,
and the increase of current produced by coating the cathodes with
these oxides is exceedingly large; in some cases investigated by
Tufts and Stark (<i>Physik. Zeits.</i>, 1908, 5, p. 248) the current was
increased many thousand times by coating the cathode with lime.
No appreciable effect is produced by putting lime on the anode.</p>

<p><i>Conduction when all the Ions are of one Sign.</i>&mdash;There are many
important cases in which the ions producing the current come from
one electrode or from a thin layer of gas close to the electrode, no
ionization occurring in the body of the gas or at the other electrode.
Among such cases may be mentioned those where one of the electrodes
is raised to incandescence while the other is cold, or when the
negative electrode is exposed to ultra-violet light. In such cases if
the electrode at which the ionization occurs is the positive electrode,
all the ions will be positively charged, while if it is the negative
electrode the ions will all be charged negatively. The theory of
this case is exceedingly simple. Suppose the electrodes are parallel
planes at right angles to the axis of x; let X be the electric force
at a distance x from the electrode where the ionization occurs, n
the number of ions (all of which are of one sign) at this place per
cubic centimetre, k the velocity of the ion under unit electric force,
e the charge on an ion, and i the current per unit area of the electrode.
Then we have dX/dx = 4&pi;ne, and if u is the velocity of the ion
neu = i. But u = kX, hence we have kX/4&pi; · dX/dx = i, and since the right
hand side of this equation does not depend upon x, we get kX²/8&pi;
= ix + C, where C is a constant to be determined. If l is the distance
between the plates, and V the potential difference between them,</p>

compared with d, and therefore <i>a fortiori</i> compared with l, so that we
are justified in this case in using equation (1).</p>

<p>From equation (2) we see that the current increases as the square
of the potential difference. Here an increase in the potential
difference produces a much greater percentage increase than in
conduction through metals, where the current is proportional to the
potential difference. When the ionization is distributed through
the gas, we have seen that the current is approximately proportional
to the square root of the potential, and so increases more slowly
with the potential difference than currents through metals. From
equation (1) the current is inversely proportional to the cube of the
distance between the electrodes, so that it falls off with great rapidity
as this distance is increased. We may note that for a given
potential difference the expression for the current does not involve q,
the rate of production of the ions at the electrode, in other words,
if we vary the ionization the current will not begin to be affected
by the strength of the ionization until this falls so low that the current
is a considerable fraction of the saturation current. For the same
potential difference the current is proportional to k, the velocity
under unit electric force of the ion which carries the current. As the
velocity of the negative ion is greater than that of the positive,
the current when the ionization is confined to the neighbourhood of
one of the electrodes will be greater when that electrode is made
cathode than when it is anode. Thus the current will appear to
pass more easily in one direction than in the opposite.</p>

<p>Since the ions which carry the current have to travel all the way
from one electrode to the other, any obstacle which is impervious
to these ions will, if placed between the electrodes, stop the current
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page874" id="page874"></a>874</span>
to the electrode where there is no ionization. A plate of metal will
be as effectual as one made of a non-conductor, and thus we get the
remarkable result that by interposing a plate of an excellent conductor
like copper or silver between the electrode, we can entirely
stop the current. This experiment can easily be tried by using a
hot plate as the electrode at which the ionization takes place: then
if the other electrode is cold the current which passes when the hot
plate is cathode can be entirely stopped by interposing a cold metal
plate between the electrodes.</p>

<p><i>Methods of counting the Number of Ions.</i>&mdash;The detection of the
ions and the estimation of their number in a given volume is
much facilitated by the property they possess of promoting the
condensation of water-drops in dust-free air supersaturated with
water vapour. If such air contains no ions, then it requires about
an eightfold supersaturation before any water-drops are formed;
if, however, ions are present C. T. R. Wilson (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>
189, p. 265) has shown that a sixfold supersaturation is sufficient
to cause the water vapour to condense round the ions and to fall
down as raindrops. The absence of the drops when no ions
are present is due to the curvature of the drop combined with the
surface tension causing, as Lord Kelvin showed, the evaporation
from a small drop to be exceeding rapid, so that even if a drop of
water were formed the evaporation would be so great in its early
stages that it would rapidly evaporate and disappear. It has
been shown, however (J. J. Thomson, <i>Application of Dynamics
to Physics and Chemistry</i>, p. 164; <i>Conduction of Electricity
through Gases</i>, 2nd ed. p. 179), that if a drop of water is charged
with electricity the effect of the charge is to diminish the evaporation;
if the drop is below a certain size the effect the charge has
in promoting condensation more than counterbalances the effect
of the surface tension in promoting evaporation. Thus the electric
charge protects the drop in the most critical period of its growth.
The effect is easily shown experimentally by taking a bulb connected
with a piston arranged so as to move with great rapidity.
When the piston moves so as to increase the volume of the air
contained in the bulb the air is cooled by expansion, and if it was
saturated with water vapour before it is supersaturated after the
expansion. By altering the throw of the piston the amount of
supersaturation can be adjusted within very wide limits. Let
it be adjusted so that the expansion produces about a sixfold
supersaturation; then if the gas is not exposed to any ionizing
agents very few drops (and these probably due to the small
amount of ionization which we have seen is always present in
gases) are formed. If, however, the bulb is exposed to strong
Röntgen rays expansion produces a dense cloud which gradually
falls down and disappears. If the gas in the bulb at the time of
its exposure to the Röntgen rays is subject to a strong electric
field hardly any cloud is formed when the gas is suddenly
expanded. The electric field removes the charged ions from the
gas as soon as they are formed so that the number of ions present
is greatly reduced. This experiment furnishes a very direct
proof that the drops of water which form the cloud are only
formed round the ions.</p>

<p>This method gives us an exceedingly delicate test for the
presence of ions, for there is no difficulty in detecting ten or so
raindrops per cubic centimetre; we are thus able to detect the
presence of this number of ions. This result illustrates the enormous
difference between the delicacy of the methods of detecting
ions and those for detecting uncharged molecules; we have seen
that we can easily detect ten ions per cubic centimetre, but there
is no known method, spectroscopic or chemical, which would
enable us to detect a billion (10<span class="sp">12</span>) times this number of uncharged
molecules. The formation of the water-drops round the charged
ions gives us a means of counting the number of ions present
in a cubic centimetre of gas; we cool the gas by sudden expansion
until the supersaturation produced by the cooling is sufficient
to cause a cloud to be formed round the ions, and the problem
of finding the number of ions per cubic centimetre of gas is thus
reduced to that of finding the number of drops per cubic centimetre
in the cloud. Unless the drops are very few and far between
we cannot do this by direct counting; we can, however, arrive
at the result in the following way. From the amount of expansion
of the gas we can calculate the lowering produced in its
temperature and hence the total quantity of water precipitated.
The water is precipitated as drops, and if all the drops are the
same size the number per cubic centimetre will be equal to the
volume of water deposited per cubic centimetre, divided by the
volume of one of the drops. Hence we can calculate the number
of drops if we know their size, and this can be determined by
measuring the velocity with which they fall under gravity through
the air.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The theory of the fall of a heavy drop of water through a viscous
fluid shows that v = <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">9</span>ga²/&mu;, where a is the radius of the drop, g the
acceleration due to gravity, and &mu; the coefficient of viscosity of the
gas through which the drop falls. Hence if we know v we can deduce
the value of a and hence the volume of each drop and the number
of drops.</p>

<p><i>Charge on Ion.</i>&mdash;By this method we can determine the number of
ions per unit volume of an ionized gas. Knowing this number we
can proceed to determine the charge on an ion. To do this let us
apply an electric force so as to send a current of electricity through
the gas, taking care that the current is only a small fraction of the
saturating current. Then if u is the sum of the velocities of the
positive and negative ions produced in the electric field applied to
the gas, the current through unit area of the gas is neu, where n is
the number of positive or negative ions per cubic centimetre, and e
the charge on an ion. We can easily measure the current through
the gas and thus determine neu; we can determine n by the method
just described, and u, the velocity of the ions under the given
electric field, is known from the experiments of Zeleny and others.
Thus since the product neu, and two of the factors n, u are known,
we can determine the other factor e, the charge on the ion. This
method was used by J. J. Thomson, and details of the method
will be found in <i>Phil. Mag.</i> [5], 46, p. 528; [5], 48, p. 547; [6], 5,
p. 346. The result of these measurements shows that the charge
on the ion is the same whether the ionization is by Röntgen rays or
by the influence of ultra-violet light on a metal plate. It is the
same whether the gas ionized is hydrogen, air or carbonic acid,
and thus is presumably independent of the nature of the gas. The
value of e formed by this method was 3.4&times;10<span class="sp">-10</span> electrostatic units.</p>

<p>H. A. Wilson (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [6], 5, p. 429) used another method.
Drops of water, as we have seen, condense more easily on negative
than on positive ions. It is possible, therefore, to adjust the expansion
so that a cloud is formed on the negative but not on the
positive ions. Wilson arranged the experiments so that such a cloud
was formed between two horizontal plates which could be maintained
at different potentials. The charged drops between the plates were
acted upon by a uniform vertical force which affected their rate of
fall. Let X be the vertical electric force, e the charge on the drop,
v<span class="su">1</span> the rate of fall of the drop when this force acts, and v the rate of
fall due to gravity alone. Then since the rate of fall is proportionate
to the force on the drop, if a is the radius of the drop, and &rho; its
density, then</p>

<p>Since 1.22 cubic centimetres of hydrogen at the temperature 15° C.
and pressure 760 mm. of mercury are liberated by the passage
through acidulated water of one electromagnetic unit of electricity
or 3&times;10<span class="sp">10</span> electrostatic units, and since in one cubic centimetre of
the gas there are 2.46 N atoms of hydrogen, we have, if E is the
charge in electrostatic units, on the atom of hydrogen in the electrolysis
of solutions</p>

<p class="center1">2.46NE = 3&times;10<span class="sp">10</span>,</p>

<p class="noind">or</p>

<p class="center1">NE = 1.22&times;10<span class="sp">10</span>.</p>

<p class="noind">The mean of the values of Ne in the preceding table is 1.24&times;10<span class="sp">10</span>.
Hence we may conclude that the charge of electricity carried by a
gaseous ion is equal to the charge carried by the hydrogen atom in
the electrolysis of solutions. The values of Ne for the different gases
differ more than we should have expected from the probable accuracy
of the determination of D and the velocity of the ions: Townsend
(<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> 80, p. 207) has shown that when the ionization is
produced by Röntgen rays some of the positive ions carry a double
charge and that this accounts for the values of Ne being greater for
the positive than for the negative ions. Since we know the value
of e, viz. 3.5&times;10<span class="sp">-10</span>, and, also Ne, = 1.24&times;10<span class="sp">10</span>, we find N the number
of molecules in a cubic centimetre of gas at standard temperature and
pressure to be equal to 3.5&times;10<span class="sp">19</span>. This method of obtaining N is
the only one which does not involve any assumption as to the shape
of the molecules and the forces acting between them.</p>

<p>Another method of determining the charge carried by an ion has
been employed by Rutherford (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> 81, pp. 141, 162),
in which the positively electrified particles emitted by radium are
made use of. The method consists of: (1) Counting the number of
&alpha; particles emitted by a given quantity of radium in a known time.
(2) Measuring the electric charge emitted by this quantity in the
same time. To count the number of the &alpha; particles the radium
was so arranged that it shot into an ionization chamber a small
number of &alpha; particles per minute; the interval between the emission
of individual particles was several seconds. When an &alpha; particle
passed into the vessel it ionized the gas inside and so greatly increased
its conductivity; thus, if the gas were kept exposed to an electric
field, the current through the gas would suddenly increase when an
&alpha; particle passed into the vessel. Although each &alpha; particle produces
about thirty thousand ions, this is hardly large enough to produce
the conductivity appreciable without the use of very delicate
apparatus; to increase the conductivity Rutherford took advantage
of the fact that ions, especially negative ones, when exposed to a
strong electric field, produce other ions by collision against the
molecules of the gas through which they are moving. By suitably
choosing the electric field and the pressure in the ionization chamber,
the 30,000 ions produced by each &alpha; particle can be multiplied to
such an extent that an appreciable current passes through the
ionization chamber on the arrival of each &alpha; particle. An electrometer
placed in series with this vessel will show by its deflection when an &alpha;
particle enters the chamber, and by counting the number of deflections
per minute we can determine the number of &alpha; particles given
out by the radium in that time. Another method of counting this
number is to let the particles fall on a phosphorescent screen, and
count the number of scintillations on the screen in a certain time.
Rutherford has shown that these two methods give concordant
results.</p>

<p>The charge of positive electricity given out by the radium was
measured by catching the &alpha; particles in a Faraday cylinder placed
in a very highly exhausted vessel, and measuring the charge per
minute received by this cylinder. In this way Rutherford showed
that the charge on the &alpha; particle was 9.4&times;10<span class="sp">-10</span> electrostatic units.
Now e/m for the &alpha; particle = 5 &times;10<span class="sp">3</span>, and there is evidence that the
&alpha; particle is a charged atom of helium; since the atomic weight of
helium is 4 and e/m for hydrogen is 10<span class="sp">4</span>, it follows that the charge
on the helium atom is twice that on the hydrogen, so that the charge
on the hydrogen atom is 4.7&times;10<span class="sp">-10</span> electrostatic units.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Calculation of the Mass of the Ions at Low Pressures.</i>&mdash;Although
at ordinary pressures the ion seems to have a very complex
structure and to be the aggregate of many molecules, yet we have
evidence that at very low pressures the structure of the ion, and
especially of the negative one, becomes very much simpler.
This evidence is afforded by determination of the mass of the
atom. We can measure the ratio of the mass of an ion to the
charge on the ion by observing the deflections produced by magnetic
and electric forces on a moving ion. If an ion carrying a
charge e is moving with a velocity v, at a point where the magnetic
force is H, a mechanical force acts on the ion, whose direction
is at right angles both to the direction of motion of the ion and
to the magnetic force, and whose magnitude is evH sin &theta;, where
&theta; is the angle between v and H. Suppose then that we have an
ion moving through a gas whose pressure is so low that the free
path of the ion is long compared with the distance through which
it moves whilst we are experimenting upon it; in this case the
motion of the ion will be free, and will not be affected by the
presence of the gas.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Since the force is always at right angles to the direction of motion
of the ion, the speed of the ion will not be altered by the action
of this force; and if the ion is projected with a velocity v in a direction
at right angles to the magnetic force, and if the magnetic force is
constant in magnitude and direction, the ion will describe a curve in
a plane at right angles to the magnetic force. If &rho; is the radius of
curvature of this curve, m the mass of the ion, mv²/&rho; must equal
the normal force acting on the ion, <i>i.e.</i> it must be equal to Hev, or
&rho; = mv/He. Thus the radius of curvature is constant; the path is
therefore a circle, and if we can measure the radius of this circle we
know the value of mv/He. In the case of the rapidly moving negative
ions projected from the cathode in a highly exhausted tube, which
are known as <i>cathode rays</i>, the path of the ions can be readily determined
since they make many substances luminous when they
impinge against them. Thus by putting a screen of such a substance
in the path of the rays the shape of the path will be determined.
Let us now suppose that the ion is acted upon by a vertical electric
force X and is free from magnetic force, if it be projected with a
horizontal velocity v, the vertical deflection y after a time t is ½&times;et²/m,
or if l is the horizontal distance travelled over by the ion in this time
we have since l = vt,</p>

     <td rowspan="2">&nbsp;</td> <td>l²</td> <td rowspan="2">.</td></tr>
<tr> <td class="denom">m</td> <td class="denom">v²</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Thus if we measure y and l we can deduce e/mv². From the effect
of the magnetic force we know e/mv. Combining these results we
can find both e/m and v.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 370px;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption sc">Fig. 13.</td></tr></table>

<p>The method by which this determination is carried out in practice
is illustrated in fig. 13. The cathode rays start from the electrode
C in a highly exhausted tube, pass through two small holes in the
plugs A and B, the holes being in the same horizontal line. Thus a
pencil of rays emerging from B is horizontal and produces a bright
spot at the far end of the
tube. In the course of
their journey to the end
of the tube they pass
between the horizontal
plates E and D, by connecting
these plates with
an electric battery a vertical
electric field is produced between E and D and the phosphorescent
spot is deflected. By measuring this deflection we determine
e/mv². The tube is now placed in a uniform magnetic field, the lines
of magnetic force being horizontal and at right angles to the plane
of the paper. The magnetic force makes the rays describe a circle in
the plane of the paper, and by measuring the vertical deflection of
the phosphorescent patch at the end of the tube we can determine
the radius of this circle, and hence the value of e/mv. From the two
observations the value of e/m and v can be calculated.</p>

<p>Another method of finding e/m for the negative ion which is
applicable in many cases to which the preceding one is not suitable,
is as follows: Let us suppose that the ion starts from rest and moves
in a field where the electric and magnetic forces are both uniform,
the electric force X being parallel to the axis of x, and the magnetic
force Z parallel to the axis of z; then if x, y, are the co-ordinates of
the ion at the time t, the equations of motion of the ion are&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">These equations show that the path of the ion is a cycloid, the
generating circle of which has a diameter equal to 2Xm/eH², and
rolls on the line x = 0.</p>

<p>Suppose now that we have a number of ions starting from the
plane x = 0, and moving towards the plane x = a. The particles
starting from x = 0 describe cycloids, and the greatest distance they
can get from the plane is equal to the diameter of the generating
circle of the cycloid, <i>i.e.</i> to 2Xm/eH². (After reaching this distance
they begin to approach the plane.) Hence if a is less than the
diameter of the generating circle, all the particles starting from
x = 0 will reach the plane x = a, if this is unlimited in extent; while
if a is greater than the diameter of the generating circle none of
the particles which start from x = 0 will reach the plane x = a. Thus,
if x = 0 is a plane illuminated by ultra-violet light, and consequently
the seat of a supply of negative ions, and x = a a plane connected
with an electrometer, then if a definite electric intensity is established
between the planes, <i>i.e.</i> if X be fixed, so that the rate of emission of
negative ions from the illuminated plate is given, and if a is less than
2Xm/eH², all the ions which start from x = 0 will reach x = a. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page876" id="page876"></a>876</span>
is, the rate at which this plane receives an electric charge will be the
same whether there is a magnetic field between the plate or not,
but if a is greater than 2Xm/eH², then no particle which starts from
the plate x = 0 will reach the plate x = a, and this plate will receive
no charge. Thus the supply of electricity to the plate has been entirely
stopped by the magnetic field. Thus, on this theory, if the
distance between the plates is less than a certain value, the magnetic
force should produce no effect on the rate at which the electrometer
plate receives a charge, while if the distance is greater than this value
the magnetic force would completely stop the supply of electricity
to the plate. The actual phenomena are not so abrupt as this theory
indicates. We find that when the plates are very near together the
magnetic force produces a very slight effect, and this an increase in
the rate of charging of the plate. On increasing the distance we come
to a stage where the magnetic force produces a great diminution in
the rate of charging. It does not, however, stop it abruptly, there
being a considerable range of distance, in which the magnetic force
diminishes but does not destroy the current. At still greater distances
the current to the plate under the magnetic force is quite
inappreciable compared with that when there is no magnetic force.
We should get this gradual instead of abrupt decay of the current
if some of the particles, instead of all starting from rest, started
with a finite velocity; in that case the first particles stopped would
be those which started from rest. This would be when a = 2Xm/eH².
Thus if we measure the value of a when the magnetic force first
begins to affect the leak to the electrometer we determine 2Xm/eH²,
and as we can easily measure X and H, we can deduce the value of m/e.</p>

<p>By these methods Thomson determined the value of e/m for
the negative ions produced when ultra-violet light falls on a
metal plate, as well as for the negative ions produced by an
incandescent carbon filament in an atmosphere of hydrogen
(<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [5], 48, p. 547) as well as for the cathode rays. It was
found that the value of e/m for the negative ions was the same
in all these cases, and that it was a constant quantity independent
of the nature of the gas from which the ions are produced and the
means used to produce them. It was found, too, that this value
was more than a thousand times the value of e/M, where e is the
charge carried by an atom of hydrogen in the electrolysis of
solutions, and M the mass of an atom of hydrogen. We have
seen that this charge is the same as that carried by the negative
ion in gases; thus since e/m is more than a thousand times e/M,
it follows that M must be more than a thousand times m. Thus
the mass of the negative ion is exceedingly small compared with
the mass of the atom of hydrogen, the smallest mass recognized in
chemistry. The production of negative ions thus involves the
splitting up of the atom, as from a collection of atoms something
is detached whose mass is less than that of a single atom. It is
important to notice in connexion with this subject that an entirely
different line of argument, based on the Zeeman effect (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Magneto-Optics</a></span>),
leads to the recognition of negatively electrified
particles for which e/m is of the same order as that deduced from
the consideration of purely electrical phenomena. These small
negatively electrified particles are called corpuscles. The latest
determinations of e/m for corpuscles available are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>It follows from electrical theory that when the corpuscles
are moving with a velocity comparable with that of light their
masses increase rapidly with their velocity. This effect has been
detected by Kauffmann (<i>Gött. Nach.</i>, Nov. 8, 1901), who used the
corpuscles shot out from radium, some of which move with
velocities only a few per cent less than that of light. Other
experiments on this point have been made by Bucherer (<i>Ann. der
Phys.</i> 28, p. 513).</p>

<p><i>Conductivity Produced by Ultra-Violet Light.</i>&mdash;So much use has
been made in recent times of ultra-violet light for producing
ions that it is desirable to give some account of the electrical
effects produced by light. The discovery by Hertz (<i>Wied. Ann.</i>
31, p. 983) in 1887, that the incidence of ultra-violet light on a
spark gap facilitates the passage of a spark, led to a series of
investigations by Hallwachs, Hoor, Righi and Stoletow, on the
effect of ultra-violet light on electrified bodies. These researches
have shown that a freshly cleaned metal surface, charged with
negative electricity, rapidly loses its charge, however small, when
exposed to ultra-violet light, and that if the surface is insulated
and without charge initially, it acquires a positive charge under
the influence of the light. The magnitude of this positive charge
may be very much increased by directing a blast of air on the plate.
This, as Zeleny (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [5], 45, p. 272) showed, has the effect
of blowing from the neighbourhood of the plate negatively
electrified gas, which has similar properties to the charged gas
obtained by the separation of ions from a gas exposed to Röntgen
rays or uranium radiation. If the metal plate is positively
electrified, there is no loss of electrification caused by ultra-violet
light. This has been questioned, but a very careful examination
of the question by Elster and Geitel (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 57, p. 24) has
shown that the apparent exceptions are due to the accidental
exposure to reflected ultra-violet light of metal surfaces in the
neighbourhood of the plate negatively electrified by induction,
so that the apparent loss of charge is due to negative electricity
coming up to the plate, and not to positive electricity going away
from it. The ultra-violet light may be obtained from an arc-lamp,
the effectiveness of which is increased if one of the terminals
is made of zinc or aluminium, the light from these substances
being very rich in ultra-violet rays; it may also be got very
conveniently by sparking with an induction coil between zinc
or cadmium terminals. Sunlight is not rich in ultra-violet light,
and does not produce anything like so great an effect as the arc
light. Elster and Geitel, who have investigated with great success
the effects of light on electrified bodies, have shown that the more
electro-positive metals lose negative charges when exposed to
ordinary light, and do not need the presence of the ultra-violet
rays. Thus they found that amalgams of sodium or potassium
enclosed in a glass vessel lose a negative charge when exposed to
daylight, though the glass stops the small amount of ultra-violet
light left in sunlight after its passage through the atmosphere.
If sodium or potassium be employed, or, what is more convenient,
the mercury-like liquid obtained by mixing sodium and potassium
in the proportion of their combining weights, they found that
negative electricity was discharged by an ordinary petroleum
lamp. If the still more electro-positive metal rubidium is used,
the discharge can be produced by the light from a glass rod just
heated to redness; but there is no discharge till the glass is luminous.
Elster and Geitel arrange the metals in the following order
for the facility with which negative electrification is discharged
by light: rubidium, potassium, alloy of sodium and potassium,
sodium, lithium, magnesium, thallium, zinc. With copper,
platinum, lead, iron, cadmium, carbon and mercury the effects
with ordinary light are too small to be appreciable. The order
is the same as that in Volta&rsquo;s electro-chemical series. With
ultra-violet light the different metals show much smaller differences
in their power of discharging negative electricity than they
do with ordinary light. Elster and Geitel found that the ratio of
the photo-electric effects of two metals exposed to approximately
monochromatic light depended upon the wave-length of the light,
different metals showing a maximum sensitiveness in different
parts of the spectrum. This is shown by the following table for
the alkaline metals. The numbers in the table are the rates of
emission of negative electricity under similar circumstances. The
rate of emission under the light from a petroleum lamp was
taken as unity:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">The table shows that the absorption of light by the metal has
great influence on the photo-electric effect, for while potassium
is more sensitive in blue light than sodium, the strong absorption
of yellow light by sodium makes it more than five times more
sensitive to this light than potassium. Stoletow, at an early
period, called attention to the connexion between strong absorption
and photo-electric effects. He showed that water, which
does not absorb to any great extent either the ultra-violet or
visible rays, does not show any photo-electric effect, while
strongly coloured solutions, and especially solutions of fluorescent
substances such as methyl green or methyl violet, do so to a very
considerable extent; indeed, a solution of methyl green is more
sensitive than zinc. Hallwachs (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 37, p. 666) proved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page877" id="page877"></a>877</span>
that in liquids showing photo-electric effects there is always strong
absorption; we may, however, have absorption without these
effects. Phosphorescent substances, such as calcium sulphide
show this effect, as also do various specimens of fluor-spar. As
phosphorescence and fluorescence are probably accompanied by
a very intense absorption by the surface layers, the evidence is
strong that to get the photo-electric effects we must have strong
absorption of some kind of light, either visible or ultra-violet.</p>

<p>If a conductor A is placed near a conductor B exposed to ultra-violet
light, and if B is made the negative electrode and a difference
of potential established between A and B, a current of
electricity will flow between the conductors. The relation between
the magnitude of the current and the difference of potential
when A and B are parallel
plates has been investigated
by Stoletow (<i>Journal
de physique</i>, 1890, 11,
p. 469), von Schweidler
(<i>Wien. Ber.</i>, 1899, 108, p.
273) and Varley (<i>Phil.
Trans. A.</i>, 1904, 202, p.
439). The results of some
of Varley&rsquo;s experiments are
represented in the curves
shown in fig. 14, in which
the ordinates are the currents
and the abscissae the
potentials. It will be seen
that when the pressure is
exceedingly low the current
is independent of the
potential difference and
is equal to the negative
charge carried off in unit
time by the corpuscles
emitted from the surface
exposed to the light. At
higher pressures the current
rises far above these values and increases rapidly with the
potential difference. This is due to the corpuscles emitted by the
illuminated surface acquiring under the electric field such high
velocities that when they strike against the molecules of the gas
through which they are passing they ionize them, producing fresh
ions which can carry on additional current. The relation between
the current and the potential difference in this case is in accordance
with the results of the theory of ionization by collision.
The corpuscles emitted from a body under the action of ultra-violet
light start from the surface with a finite velocity. The
velocity is not the same for all the corpuscles, nor indeed could
we expect that it should be: for as Ladenburg has shown
(<i>Ann. der Phys.</i>, 1903, 12, p. 558) the seat of their emission is not
confined to the surface layer of the illuminated metal but extends
to a layer of finite, though small, thickness. Thus the particles
which start deep down will have to force their way through a
layer of metal before they reach the surface, and in doing so will
have their velocities retarded by an amount depending on the
thickness of this layer. The variation in the velocity of the
corpuscles is shown in the following table, due to Lenard (<i>Ann.
der Phys.</i>, 1902, 8, p. 149).</p>

<p class="noind">If the illuminated surface is completely surrounded by an envelope
of the same metal insulated from and completely shielded from
the light, the emission of the negative corpuscles from the illuminated
surface would go on until the potential difference V
between this surface and the envelope became so great that the
corpuscles with the greatest velocity lost their energy before
reaching the envelope, <i>i.e.</i> if m is the mass, e the charge on a
corpuscle, v the greatest velocity of projection, until Ve = ½mv².
The values found for V by different observers are not very
consistent. Lenard found that V for aluminium was about 3
volts and for platinum 2. Millikan and Winchester (<i>Phil.
Mag.</i>, July 1907) found for aluminium V = .738. The apparatus
used by them was so complex that the interpretation of their
results is difficult.</p>

<p>An extremely interesting fact discovered by Lenard is that the
velocity with which the corpuscles are emitted from the metal is
independent of the intensity of the incident light. The quantity
of corpuscles increases with the intensity, but the velocity of the
individual corpuscles does not. It is worthy of notice that in
other cases when negative corpuscles are emitted from metals,
as for example when the metals are exposed to cathode rays,
Canal-strahlen, or Röntgen rays, the velocity of the emitted
corpuscles is independent of the intensity of the primary radiation
which excites them. The velocity is not, however, independent
of the nature of the primary rays. Thus when light is used
to produce the emission of corpuscles the velocity, as Ladenburg
has shown, depends on the wave length of the light, increasing
as the wave length diminishes. The velocity of corpuscles
emitted under the action of cathode rays is greater than that
of those ejected by light, while the incidence of Röntgen rays
produces the emission of corpuscles moving much more rapidly
than those in the cases already mentioned, and the harder the
primary rays the greater is the velocity of the corpuscles.</p>

<p>The importance of the fact that the velocity and therefore the
energy of the corpuscles emitted from the metal is independent
of the intensity of the incident light can hardly be overestimated.
It raises the most fundamental questions as to the nature of light
and the constitution of the molecules. What is the source of
the energy possessed by these corpuscles? Is it the light, or in the
stores of internal energy possessed by the molecule? Let us
follow the consequences of supposing that the energy comes from
the light. Then, since the energy is independent of the intensity
of the light, the electric forces which liberate the corpuscles must
also be independent of that intensity. But this cannot be the
case if, as is usually assumed in the electromagnetic theory, the
wave front consists of a uniform distribution of electric force
without structure, for in this case the magnitude of the electric
force is proportional to the square root of the intensity. On the
emission theory of light a difficulty of this kind would not arise,
for on that theory the energy in a luminiferous particle remains
constant as the particle pursues its flight through space. Thus any
process which a single particle is able to effect by virtue of its
energy will be done just as well a thousand miles away from the
source of light as at the source itself, though of course in a given
space there will not be nearly so many particles to do this process
far from the source as there are close in. Thus, if one of the
particles when it struck against a piece of metal caused the
ejection of a corpuscle with a given velocity, the velocity of
emission would not depend on the intensity of the light. There
does not seem any reason for believing that the electromagnetic
theory is inconsistent with the idea that on this theory, as on the
emission theory, the energy in the light wave may instead of being
uniformly distributed through space be concentrated in bundles
which occupy only a small fraction of the volume traversed by
the light, and that as the wave travels out the bundles get farther
apart, the energy in each remaining undiminished. Some such
view of the structure of light seems to be required to account for
the fact that when a plate of metal is struck by a wave of ultra-violet
light, it would take years before the corpuscles emitted
from the metal would equal in number the molecules on the
surface of the metal plate, and yet on the ordinary theory of light
each one of these is without interruption exposed to the action of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page878" id="page878"></a>878</span>
the light. The fact discovered by E. Ladenburg (<i>Verh. d.
deutsch. physik. Ges.</i> 9, p. 504) that the velocity with which
the corpuscles are emitted depends on the wave length of the
light suggests that the energy in each bundle depends upon the
wave length and increases as the wave length diminishes.</p>

<p>These considerations illustrate the evidence afforded by photo-electric
effects on the nature of light; these effects may also
have a deep significance with regard to the structure of matter.
The fact that the energy of the individual corpuscles is independent
of the intensity of the light might be explained by the
hypothesis that the energy of the corpuscles does not come from
the light but from the energy stored up in the molecules of the
metal exposed to the light. We may suppose that under the
action of the light some of the molecules are thrown into an
unstable state and explode, ejecting corpuscles; the light in this
case acts only as a trigger to liberate the energy in the atom, and
it is this energy and not that of the light which goes into the
corpuscles. In this way the velocity of the corpuscles would be
independent of the intensity of the light. But it may be asked,
is this view consistent with the result obtained by Ladenburg
that the velocity of the corpuscles depends upon the nature of
the light? If light of a definite wave length expelled corpuscles
with a definite and uniform velocity, it would be very improbable
that the emission of the corpuscles is due to an explosion of the
atoms. The experimental facts as far as they are known at
present do not allow us to say that the connexion between the
velocity of the corpuscles and the wave length of the light is of
this definite character, and a connexion such as a gradual increase
of average velocity as the wave length of the light diminishes,
would be quite consistent with the view that the corpuscles are
ejected by the explosion of the atom. For in a complex thing like
an atom there may be more than one system which becomes unstable
when exposed to light. Let us suppose that there are
two such systems, A and B, of which B ejects the corpuscles with
the greater velocity. If B is more sensitive to the short waves,
and A to the long ones, then as the wave length of the light
diminishes the proportion of the corpuscles which come from B
will increase, and as these are the faster, the average velocity of
the corpuscles emitted will also increase. And although the
potential acquired by a perfectly insulated piece of metal when
exposed to ultra-violet light would depend only on the velocity
of the fastest corpuscles and not upon their number, in practice
perfect insulation is unattainable, and the potential actually
acquired is determined by the condition that the gain of negative
electricity by the metal through lack of insulation, is equal to the
loss by the emission of negatively electrified corpuscles. The
potential acquired will fall below that corresponding to perfect
insulation by an amount depending on the number of the faster
corpuscles emitted, and the potential will rise if the proportion of
the rapidly moving corpuscles is increased, even though there is
no increase in their velocity. It is interesting to compare other
cases in which corpuscles are emitted with the case of ultra-violet
light. When a metal or gas is bombarded by cathode rays it
emits corpuscles and the velocity of these is found to be independent
of the velocity of the cathode rays which excite them; the
velocity is greater than for corpuscles emitted under ultra-violet
light. Again, when bodies are exposed to Röntgen rays they emit
corpuscles moving with a much greater velocity than those
excited by cathode rays, but again the velocity does not depend
upon the intensity of the rays although it does to some extent
on their hardness. In the case of cathode and Röntgen rays, the
velocity with which the corpuscles are emitted seems, as far as we
know at present, to vary slightly, but only slightly, with the
nature of the substance on which the rays fall. May not this
indicate that the first effect of the primary rays is to detach a
neutral doublet, consisting of a positive and negative charge,
this doublet being the same from whatever system it is detached?
And that the doublet is unstable and explodes, expelling the
negative charge with a high velocity, and the positive one,
having a much larger charge, with a much smaller velocity,
the momentum of the negative charge being equal to that of the
positive.</p>

<p>Up to now we have been considering the effects produced when
light is incident on metals. Lenard found (and the result has
been confirmed by the experiments of J. J. Thomson and
Lyman) that certain kinds of ultra-violet light ionize a gas
when they pass through. The type of ultra-violet light
which produces this effect is so easily absorbed that it is
stopped by a layer a few millimetres thick of air at atmospheric
pressure.</p>

<p><i>Ionization by Collision.</i>&mdash;When the ionization of the gas is
produced by external agents such as Röntgen rays or ultra-violet
light, the electric field produces a current by setting the
positive ions moving in one direction, and the negative ones in the
opposite; it makes use of ions already made and does not itself
give rise to ionization. In many cases, however, such as in
electric sparks, there are no external agents to produce ionization
and the electric field has to produce the ions as well as set them in
motion. When the ionization is produced by external means the
smallest electric field is able to produce a current through the
gas; when, however, these external means are absent no current
is produced unless the strength of the electric field exceeds a
certain critical value, which depends not merely upon the nature
of the gas but also upon the pressure and the dimensions of
the vessel in which it is contained. The variation of the electric
field required to produce discharge can be completely explained
if we suppose that the ionization of the gas is produced by the
impact with its molecules of corpuscles, and in certain cases of
positive ions, which under the influence of the electric field
have acquired considerable kinetic energy. We have direct
evidence that rapidly moving corpuscles are able to ionize
molecules against which they strike, for the cathode rays consist
of such corpuscles, and these when they pass through a gas
produce large amounts of ionization. Suppose then that we
have in a gas exposed to an electric field a few corpuscles. These
will be set in motion by the field and will acquire an amount
of energy in proportion to the product of the electric force,
their charge, and the distance travelled in the direction of the
electric field between two collisions with the molecules of the
gas. If this energy is sufficient to give them the ionizing property
possessed by cathode rays, then when a corpuscle strikes against
a molecule it will detach another corpuscle; this under the action
of the electric field will acquire enough energy to produce
corpuscles on its own account, and so as the corpuscles move
through the gas their number will increase in geometrical progression.
Thus, though there were but few corpuscles to begin
with, there may be great ionization after these have been
driven some distance through the gas by the electric field.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The number of ions produced by collisions can be calculated by
the following method. Let the electric force be parallel to the axis
of x, and let n be the number of corpuscles per unit volume at a place
fixed by the co-ordinate x; then in unit time these corpuscles will
make nu/&lambda; collisions with the molecules, if u is the velocity of a
corpuscle and &lambda; the mean free path of a corpuscle. When the
corpuscles are moving fast enough to produce ions by collision their
velocities are very much greater than those they would possess at
the same temperature if they were not acted on by electrical force,
and so we may regard the velocities as being parallel to the axis of x
and determined by the electric force and the mean free path of the
corpuscles. We have to consider how many of the nu/&lambda; collisions
which take place per second will produce ions. We should expect
that the ionization of a molecule would require a certain amount of
energy, so that if the energy of the corpuscle fell below this amount
no ionization would take place, while if the energy of the corpuscle
were exceedingly large, every collision would result in ionization.
We shall suppose that a certain fraction of the number of collisions
result in ionization and that this fraction is a function of the energy
possessed by the corpuscle when it collides against the molecules.
This energy is proportional to Xe&lambda; when X is the electric force,
e the charge on the corpuscle, and &lambda; the mean free path. If the
fraction of collisions which produce ionization is &int; (Xe&lambda;), then
the number of ions produced per cubic centimetre per second is
&int; (Xe&lambda;)nu/&lambda;. If the collisions follow each other with great rapidity
so that a molecule has not had time to recover from one collision
before it is struck again, the effect of collisions might be cumulative,
so that a succession of collisions might give rise to ionization, though
none of the collisions would produce an ion by itself. In this case &int;
would involve the frequency of the collisions as well as the energy
of the corpuscle; in other words, it might depend on the current
through the gas as well as upon the intensity of the electric field.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page879" id="page879"></a>879</span>
We shall, however, to begin with, assume that the current is so small
that this cumulative effect may be neglected.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the rate of increase, dn/dt, in the number of
corpuscles per unit volume. In consequence of the collisions,
&int; (Xe&lambda;)nu/&lambda; corpuscles are produced per second; in consequence
of the motion of the corpuscles, the number which leave unit volume
per second is greater than those which enter it by d/dx · (nu); while in a
certain number of collisions a corpuscle will stick to the molecule and
will thus cease to be a free corpuscle. Let the fraction of the number
of collisions in which this occurs be &beta;. Thus the gain in the number
of corpuscles is &int; (Xe&lambda;)nu/&lambda;, while the loss is d/dx·(nu) + &beta;·nu/&lambda; hence</p>

<p class="noind">If the current is so small that the electrical charges in the gas are
not able to produce any appreciable variations in the field, X will be
constant and we get nu = C&epsilon;<span class="sp">&alpha;x</span>, where &alpha; = {&int; (Xe&lambda;) &minus; &beta;}/&lambda;. If we take
the origin from which we measure x at the cathode, C is the value
of nu at the cathode, <i>i.e.</i> it is the number of corpuscles emitted per
unit area of the cathode per unit time; this is equal to i<span class="su">0</span>/e if i<span class="su">0</span> is
the quantity of negative electricity coming from unit area of the
cathode per second, and e the electric charge carried by a corpuscle.
Hence we have nue = i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">&alpha;x</span>. If l is the distance between the anode
and the cathode, the value of nue, when x = l, is the current passing
through unit area of the gas, if we neglect the electricity carried by
negatively electrified carriers other than corpuscles. Hence i = i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">&alpha; l</span>.
Thus the current between the plates increases in geometrical
progression with the distance between the plates.</p>

<p>By measuring the variation of the current as the distance between
the plates is increased, Townsend, to whom we owe much of our
knowledge on this subject, determined the values of &alpha; for different
values of X and for different pressures for air, hydrogen and carbonic
acid gas (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [6], 1, p. 198). Since &lambda; varies inversely as the
pressure, we see that &alpha; may be written in the form p&phi;(X/p) or
&alpha;/X = F(X/p). The following are some of the values of &alpha; found by
Townsend for air.</p>

<p class="noind">We see from this table that for a given value of X, &alpha; for small pressures
increases as the pressure increases; it attains a maximum at a
particular pressure, and then diminishes as the pressure increases.
The increase in the pressure increases the number of collisions, but
diminishes the energy acquired by the corpuscle in the electric
field, and thus diminishes the change of any one collision resulting
in ionization. If we suppose the field is so strong that at some
particular pressure the energy acquired by the corpuscle is well
above the value required to ionize at each collision, then it is evident
that increasing the number of collisions will increase the amount
of ionization, and therefore &alpha;, and &alpha; cannot begin to diminish until
the pressure has increased to such an extent that the mean free
path of a corpuscle is so small that the energy acquired by the
corpuscle from the electric field falls below the value when each
collision results in ionization.</p>

<p>The value of p, when X is given, for which &alpha; is a maximum, is
proportional to X; this follows at once from the fact that &alpha; is of the
form X·F(X/p). The value of X/p for which F(X/p) is a maximum
is seen from the preceding table to be about 420, when X is expressed
in volts per centimetre and p in millimetres of mercury. The
maximum value of F(X/p) is about <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">60</span>. Since the current passing
between two planes at a distance l apart is i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">&alpha;l</span> or i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">XlF(X/p)</span>,
and since the force between the plates is supposed to be uniform,
Xl is equal to V, the potential between the plates; hence the
current between the plates is i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">V·F(X/p)</span>, and the greatest value
it can have is i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">V/60</span>. Thus the ratio between the current between
the plates when there is ionization and when there is none cannot
be greater than &epsilon;<span class="sp">V/60</span>, when V is measured in volts. This result is
based on Townsend&rsquo;s experiments with very weak currents; we
must remember, however, that when the collisions are so frequent
that the effects of collisions can accumulate, &alpha; may have much larger
values than when the current is small. In some experiments made
by J. J. Thomson with intense currents from cathodes covered
with hot lime, the increase in the current when the potential difference
was 60 volts, instead of being e times the current when there was no
ionization, as the preceding theory indicates, was several hundred
times that value, thus indicating a great increase in &alpha; with the
strength of the current.</p>

<p>Townsend has shown that we can deduce from the values of &alpha; the
mean free path of a corpuscle. For if the ionization is due to the
collisions with the corpuscles, then unless one collision detaches
more than one corpuscle the maximum number of corpuscles produced
will be equal to the number of collisions. When each collision
results in the production of a corpuscle, &alpha; = 1/&lambda; and is independent
of the strength of the electric field. Hence we see that the value of
&alpha;, when it is independent of the electric field, is equal to the reciprocal
of the free path. Thus from the table we infer that at a pressure
of 17 mm. the mean free path is <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">325</span> cm.; hence at 1 mm. the mean
free path of a corpuscle is <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">19</span> cm. Townsend has shown that this
value of the mean free path agrees well with the value <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">21</span> cm.
deduced from the kinetic theory of gases for a corpuscle moving
through air. By measuring the values of &alpha; for hydrogen and carbonic
acid gas Townsend and Kirby (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [6], 1, p. 630) showed
that the mean free paths for corpuscles in these gases are respectively
<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">11.5</span> and <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">29</span> cm. at a pressure of 1 mm. These results again agree
well with the values given by the kinetic theory of gases.</p>

<p>If the number of positive ions per unit volume is m and v is the
velocity, we have nue + mve = i, where i is the current through unit
area of the gas. Since nue = i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">nx</span> and i = i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">nl</span>, when l is the distance
between the plates, we see that</p>

<p class="center1">nu / mv = &epsilon;<span class="sp">nx</span> / (&epsilon;<span class="sp">nl</span> &minus; &epsilon;<span class="sp">nx</span>),</p>

<p class="noind">Since v/u is a very small quantity we see that n will be less than m
except when &epsilon;<span class="sp">nl</span> - &epsilon;<span class="sp">nx</span> is small, <i>i.e.</i> except close to the anode. Thus
there will be an excess of positive electricity from the cathode almost
up to the anode, while close to the anode there will be an excess of
negative. This distribution of electricity will make the electric
force diminish from the cathode to the place where there is as much
positive as negative electricity, where it will have its minimum
value, and then increase up to the anode.</p>

<p>The expression i = i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">&alpha;l</span> applies to the case when there is no source
of ionization in the gas other than the collisions; if in addition to
this there is a source of uniform ionization producing q ions per cubic

<p class="noind">With regard to the minimum energy which must be possessed by a
corpuscle to enable it to produce ions by collision, Townsend (loc.
cit.) came to the conclusion that to ionize air the corpuscle must
possess an amount of energy equal to that acquired by the fall of its
charge through a potential difference of about 2 volts. This is also
the value arrived at by H. A. Wilson by entirely different considerations.
Stark, however, gives 17 volts as the minimum for ionization.
The energy depends upon the nature of the gas; recent experiments by
Dawes and Gill and Pedduck (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, Aug. 1908) have shown that
it is smaller for helium than for air, hydrogen, or carbonic acid gas.</p>
</div>

<p>If there is no external source of ionization and no emission of
corpuscles from the cathode, then it is evident that even if some
corpuscles happened to be present in the gas when the electric
field were applied, we could not get a permanent current by
the aid of collisions made by these corpuscles. For under the
electric field, the corpuscles would be driven from the cathode
to the anode, and in a short time all the corpuscles originally
present in the gas and those produced by them would be driven
from the gas against the anode, and if there was no source from
which fresh corpuscles could be introduced into the gas the
current would cease. The current, however, could be maintained
indefinitely if the positive ions in their journey back to the cathode
also produced ions by collisions, for then we should have a kind
of regenerative process by which the supply of corpuscles could
be continually renewed. To maintain the current it is not necessary
that the ionization resulting from the positive ions should be
anything like as great as that from the negative, as the investigation
given below shows a very small amount of ionization by the
positive ions will suffice to maintain the current. The existence
of ionization by collision with positive ions has been proved by
Townsend. Another method by which the current could be
and is maintained is by the anode emitting corpuscles under the
impact of the positive ions driven against it by the electric field.
J. J. Thomson has shown by direct experiment that positively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page880" id="page880"></a>880</span>
electrified particles when they strike against a metal plate cause
the metal to emit corpuscles (J. J. Thomson, <i>Proc. Camb. Phil.
Soc.</i> 13, p. 212; Austin, <i>Phys. Rev.</i> 22, p. 312). If we assume
that the number of corpuscles emitted by the plate in one second
is proportional to the energy in the positive ions which strike
the plate in that second, we can readily find an expression for
the difference of potential which will maintain without any
external ionization a current of electricity through the gas.
As this investigation brings into prominence many of the most
important features of the electric discharge, we shall consider it
in some detail.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Let us suppose that the electrodes are parallel plates of metal at
right angles to the axis of x, and that at the cathode x = 0 and at the
anode x = d, d being thus the distance between the plates. Let us
also suppose that the current of electricity flowing between the plates
is so small that the electrification between the plates due to the
accumulation of ions is not sufficient to disturb appreciably the
electric field, which we regard as uniform between the plates, the
electric force being equal to V/d, where V is the potential difference
between the plates. The number of positive ions produced per
second in a layer of gas between the planes x and x + dx is &alpha;nu·dx.
Here n is the number of corpuscles per unit volume, &alpha; the coefficient
of ionization (for strong electric field &alpha; = 1/&lambda;&prime;, where &lambda;&prime; is the mean
free path of a corpuscle), and u the velocity of a corpuscle parallel
to x. We have seen that nu = i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">&alpha;x</span>, where i<span class="su">0</span> is the number of
corpuscles emitted per second by unit area of the cathode. Thus
the number of positive ions produced in the layer is &alpha;i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">&alpha;x</span> dx. If
these went straight to the cathode without a collision, each of them
would have received an amount of kinetic energy Vex/d when
they struck the cathode, and the energy of the group of ions would
be Vex/d·&alpha;i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">dx</span> dx. The positive ions will, however, collide with
the molecules of the gas through which they are passing, and this
will diminish the energy they possess when they reach the cathode.</p>

<p>The diminution in the energy will increase in geometrical proportion
with the length of path travelled by the ion and will thus
be proportional to &epsilon;<span class="sp">&minus;&beta;x</span>, &beta; will be proportional to the number of
collisions and will thus be proportional to the pressure of the gas.
Thus the kinetic energy possessed by the ions when they reach the
cathode will be</p>

<p class="center1">&epsilon;<span class="sp">&minus;&beta;x</span>·V(ex/d) · &alpha; i<span class="su">0</span>&epsilon;<span class="sp">&alpha;x</span> dx,</p>

the cathode in unit time, will be given by the equation</p>

<p class="noind">Since both &beta; and &alpha; are proportional to the pressure, I and (&beta; &minus; &alpha;)²d/&alpha;
are both functions of pd, the product of the pressure and the spark
length, hence we see that V is expressed by an equation of the form</p>

<p class="noind">where &int; (pd) denotes a function of pd, and neither p nor d enter into
the expression for V except in this product. Thus the potential
difference required to produce discharge is constant as long as the
product of the pressure and spark length remains constant; in
other words, the spark potential is constant as long as the mass
of the gas between the electrodes is constant. Thus, for example,
if we halve the pressure the same potential difference will produce
a spark of twice the length. This law, which was discovered by
Paschen for fairly long sparks (<i>Annalen</i>, 37, p. 79), and has been
shown by Carr (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1903) to hold for short ones, is one of
the most important properties of the electric discharge.</p>

<p>We see from the expression for V that when (&beta; &minus; &alpha;)d is very large</p>

<p class="center1">V = (&beta; &minus; &alpha;)²d/ke&alpha;.</p>

<p class="noind">Thus V becomes infinite when d is infinite. Again when (&beta; &minus; &alpha;)d
is very small we find</p>

<p class="center1">V = 1/ke&alpha;d;</p>

<p class="noind">thus V is again infinite when d is nothing. There must therefore
be some value of d intermediate between zero and infinity for which
V is a minimum. This value is got by finding in the usual way the
value of d, which makes the expression for V given in equation (1)
a minimum. We find that d must satisfy the equation</p>

<p class="center1">1 = &epsilon;<span class="sp">&minus;(&beta;&minus;&alpha;)d</span> {1 + (&beta; &minus; &alpha;)d + (&beta; &minus; &alpha;·d)²}.</p>

<p class="noind">We find by a process of trial and error that (&beta; &minus; &alpha;)d = 1.8 is approximately
a solution of this equation; hence the distance for minimum
potential is 1.8/(&beta; &minus; &alpha;). Since &beta; and &alpha; are both proportional to the
pressure, we see that the critical spark length varies inversely as
the pressure. If we substitute this value in the expression for V
we find that <span class="ov">V</span>, the minimum spark potential, is given by</p>

<p class="noind">Since &beta; and &alpha; are each proportional to the pressure, the minimum
potential is independent of the pressure of the gas. On this view
the minimum potential depends upon the metal of which the cathode
is made, since k measures the number of corpuscles emitted per unit
time by the cathode when struck by positive ions carrying unit
energy, and unless &beta; bears the same ratio to &alpha; for all gases the
minimum potential will also vary with the gas. The measurements
which have been made of the &ldquo;cathode fall of potential,&rdquo; which as
we shall see is equal to the minimum potential required to produce a
spark, show that this quantity varies with the material of which the
cathode is made and also with the nature of the gas. Since a metal
plate, when bombarded by positive ions, emits corpuscles, the effect
we have been considering must play a part in the discharge; it is
not, however, the only effect which has to be considered, for as
Townsend has shown, positive ions when moving above a certain
speed ionize the gas, and cause it to emit corpuscles. It is thus
necessary to take into account the ionization of the positive ions.</p>

<p>Let m be the number of positive ions per unit volume, and w
their velocity, the number of collisions which occur in one second
in one cubic centimetre of the gas will be proportional to mwp,
where p is the pressure of the gas. Let the number of ions which
result from these collisions be &gamma;mw; &gamma; will be a function of p and
of the strength of the electric field. Let as before n be the number
of corpuscles per cubic centimetre, u their velocity, and &alpha;nu the
number of ions which result in one second from the collisions between
the corpuscles and the gas. The number of ions produced per
second per cubic centimetre is equal to &alpha;nu + &gamma;mw; hence when
things are in a steady state</p>

</div>

<p>In the preceding investigation we have supposed that the
electric field between the plates was uniform; if it were not
uniform we could get discharges produced by very much smaller
differences of potential than are necessary in a uniform field.
For to maintain the discharge it is not necessary that the positive
ions should act as ionizers all along their path; it is sufficient
that they should do so in the neighbourhood of cathode. Thus
if we have a strong field close to the cathode we might still get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page881" id="page881"></a>881</span>
the discharge though the rest of the field were comparatively
weak. Such a distribution of electric force requires, however,
a great accumulation of charged ions near the cathode; until
these ions accumulate the field will be uniform. If the uniform
field existing in the gas before the discharge begins were strong
enough to make the corpuscles produce ions by collision, but not
strong enough to make the positive ions act as ionizers, there
would be some accumulation of ions, and the amount of this
accumulation would depend upon the number of free corpuscles
originally present in the gas, and upon the strength of the electric
field. If the accumulation were sufficient to make the field
near the cathode so strong that the positive ions could produce
fresh ions either by collision with the cathode or with the gas,
the discharge would pass though the gas; if not, there will be no
continuous discharge. As the amount
of the accumulation depends on the
number of corpuscles present in the gas,
we can understand how it is that after
a spark has passed, leaving for a time
a supply of corpuscles behind it, it is
easier to get a discharge to pass through
the gas than it was before.</p>

<p>The inequality of the electric field in
the gas when a continuous discharge is
passing through it is very obvious when
the pressure of the gas is low. In this
case the discharge presents a highly
differentiated appearance of which a
type is represented in fig. 15. Starting
from the cathode we have a thin velvety
luminous glow in contact with the surface;
this glow is
often called the &ldquo;first
cathode layer.&rdquo; Next
this we have a comparatively
dark space
whose thickness increases
as the pressure
diminishes; this is
called the &ldquo;Crookes&rsquo;s dark space,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;second cathode layer.&rdquo; Next this we have
a luminous position called the &ldquo;negative
glow&rdquo; or the &ldquo;third cathode layer.&rdquo; The
boundary between the second and third layers
is often very sharply defined. Next to the
third layer we have another dark space called
the &ldquo;Faraday dark space.&rdquo; Next to this and reaching up to the
anode is another region of luminosity, called the &ldquo;positive
column,&rdquo; sometimes (as in fig. 15, a) continuous, sometimes (as
in fig. 15, b) broken up into light or dark patches called &ldquo;striations.&rdquo;
The dimensions of the Faraday dark space and the positive
column vary greatly with the current passing through the
gas and with its pressure; sometimes one or
other of them is absent. These differences
in appearances are accompanied by great
difference in the strength of the electric
field. The magnitude of the electric force
at different parts of the discharge is represented
in fig. 16, where the ordinates represent
the electric force at different parts of
the tube, the cathode being on the right.
We see that the electric force is very large indeed between the
negative glow and the cathode, much larger than in any other
part of the tube. It is not constant in this region, but increases
as we approach the cathode. The force reaches a minimum
either in the negative glow itself or in the part of the Faraday
dark space just outside, after which it increases towards the
positive column. In the case of a uniform positive column the
electric force along it is constant until we get quite close to the
anode, when a sudden change, called the &ldquo;anode fall,&rdquo; takes
place in the potential.</p>

<p>The difference of potential between the cathode and the
negative glow is called the &ldquo;cathode potential fall&rdquo; and is
found to be constant for wide variations in the pressure of the
gas and the current passing through. It increases, however,
considerably when the current through the gas exceeds a certain
critical value, depending among other things on the size of the
cathode. This cathode fall of potential is shown by experiment
to be very approximately equal to the minimum potential
difference. The following table contains a comparison of the
measurements of the cathode fall of potentials in various gases
made by Warburg (<i>Wied. Ann.</i>, 1887, 31, p. 545, and 1890, 40,

(<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1900, 193, p. 377), and the measurements by Strutt
of the smallest difference of potential which will maintain a
spark through these gases.</p>

with the greatest accuracy the agreement between the cathode
fall and the minimum potential difference is very close. The

<p>The dependence of the minimum potential required to produce
a spark upon the metal of which the cathode is made has not
been clearly established, some observers being unable to detect
any difference between the potential required to spark between
electrodes of aluminium and those of brass, while others thought
they had detected such a difference. It is only with sparks
not much longer than the critical spark length that we could
hope to detect this difference. When the current through the
gas exceeds a certain critical value depending among other
things on the size of the cathode, the cathode fall of potential
increases rapidly and at the same time the thickness of the dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page882" id="page882"></a>882</span>
spaces diminishes. We may regard the part of the discharge
between the cathode and the negative glow as a discharge taking
place under minimum potential difference through a distance
equal to the critical spark length. An inspection of fig. 16 will
show that we cannot regard the electric field as constant even
for this small distance; it thus becomes a matter of interest to
know what would be the effect on the minimum potential
difference required to produce a spark if there were sufficient
ions present to produce variations in the electric field analogous
to those represented in fig. 16. If the electric force at a distance
x from the cathode were proportional to &epsilon;<span class="sp">-px</span> we should have a
state of things much resembling the distribution of electric
force near the cathode. If we apply to this distribution the
methods used above for the case when the force was uniform,
we shall find that the minimum potential is less and the
critical spark length greater than when the electric force is
uniform.</p>

<p><i>Potential Difference required to produce a Spark of given Length.</i>&mdash;We
may regard the region between the cathode and the negative
glow as a place for the production of corpuscles, these corpuscles
finding their way from this region through the negative glow.
The parts of this glow towards the anode we may regard as a
cathode, from which, as from a hot lime cathode, corpuscles are
emitted. Let us now consider what will happen to these corpuscles
shot out from the negative glow with a velocity depending
on the cathode fall of potential and independent of the pressure.
These corpuscles will collide with the molecules of the gas, and
unless there is an external electric field to maintain their velocity
they will soon come to rest and accumulate in front of the
negative glow. The electric force exerted by this cloud of
corpuscles will diminish the strength of the electric field in the
region between the cathode and the negative glow, and thus
tend to stop the discharge. To keep up the discharge we must
have a sufficiently strong electric field between the negative
glow and the anode to remove the corpuscles from this region as
fast as they are sent into it from the cathode. If, however,
there is no production of ions in the region between the negative
glow and the anode, all the ions in this region will have come
from near the cathode and will be negatively charged; this
negative electrification will diminish the electric force on the
cathode side of it and thus tend to stop the discharge. This
back electric field could, however, be prevented by a little ionization
in the region between the anode and glow, for this would
afford a supply of positive ions, and thus afford an opportunity
for the gas in this region to have in it as many positive as negative
ions; in this case it would not give rise to any back electromotive
force. The ionization which produces these positive
ions may, if the field is intense, be due to the collisions of corpuscles,
or it may be due to radiation analogous to ultra-violet,
or soft Röntgen rays, which have been shown by experiment
to accompany the discharge. Thus in the most simple conditions
for discharge we should have sufficient ionization to keep up the
supply of positive ions, and an electric field strong enough to
keep the velocity of the negative corpuscle equal to the value
it has when it emerges from the negative glow. Thus the force
must be such as to give a constant velocity to the corpuscle,
and since the force required to move an ion with a given velocity
is proportional to the pressure, this force will be proportional
to the pressure of the gas. Let us call this force ap; then if l
is the distance of the anode from the negative glow the potential
difference between these points will be alp. The potential
difference between the negative glow and the cathode is constant
and equals c; hence if V is the potential difference between
the anode and cathode, then V = c + alp, a relation which expresses
the connexion between the potential difference and
spark length for spark lengths greater than the critical distance.
It is to be remembered that the result we have obtained applies
only to such a case as that indicated above, where the electric
force is constant along the positive column. Experiments
with the discharge through gases at low pressure show the
discharge may take other forms. Thus the positive column
may be striated when the force along it is no longer uniform,
or the positive column may be absent; the discharge may be
changed from one of these forms to another by altering the
current. The relation between the potential and the distance
between the electrodes varies greatly, as we might expect, with
the current passing through the gas.</p>

<p>The connexion between the potential difference and the
spark length has been made the subject of a large number of
experiments. The first measurements were made by Lord
Kelvin in 1860 (<i>Collected Papers on Electrostatics and Magnetism</i>,
p. 247); subsequent experiments have been made by Baille
(<i>Ann. de chimie et de physique</i>, 5, 25, p. 486), Liebig (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>
[5], 24, p. 106), Paschen (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 37, p. 79), Peace (<i>Proc. Roy.
Soc.</i>, 1892, 52, p. 99), Orgler (<i>Ann. der Phys.</i> 1, p. 159), Strutt
(<i>Phil. Trans.</i> 193, p. 377), Bouty (<i>Comptes rendus</i>, 131, pp. 469,
503), Earhart (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [6], 1, p. 147), Carr (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1903),
Russell (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [5], 64, p. 237), Hobbs (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [6], 10,
p. 617), Kinsley (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [6], 9, 692), Ritter (<i>Ann. der Phys.</i>
14, p. 118). The results of their experiments show that for sparks
considerably longer than the critical spark length, the relation
between the potential difference V and the spark length l may
be expressed when the electrodes are large with great accuracy
by the linear relation V = c + blp, where p is the pressure and
c and b are constants depending on the nature of the gas. When
the sparks are long the term blp is the most important and the
sparking potential is proportional to the spark length. Though
there are considerable discrepancies between the results obtained
by different observers, these indicate that the production of a
long spark between large electrodes in air at atmospheric pressure
requires a potential difference of 30,000 volts for each centimetre
of spark length. In hydrogen only about half this potential
difference is required, in carbonic acid gas the potential difference
is about the same as in air, while Ritter&rsquo;s experiments show
that in helium only about one-tenth of this potential difference
is required.</p>

<p>In the case when the electric field is not uniform, as for example
when the discharge takes place between spherical electrodes,
Russell&rsquo;s experiments show that the discharge takes place as
soon as the maximum electric force in the field between the
electrodes reaches a definite value, which he found was for air at
atmospheric pressure about 38,000 volts per centimetre.</p>

<p><i>Very Short Sparks.</i>&mdash;Some very interesting experiments on the
potential difference required to produce exceedingly short sparks
have been made by Earhart, Hobbs and Kinsley; the length of
these sparks was comparable with the wave length of sodium
light. With sparks of these lengths it was found that it was
possible to get a discharge with less than 330 volts, the minimum
potential difference in air. The results of these observers show
that there is no diminution in the minimum potential difference
required to produce discharge until the spark length gets so small
that the average electric force between the electrodes amounts to
about one million volts per centimetre. When the force rises to
this value a discharge takes place even though the potential
difference is much less than 330 volts; in some of Earhart&rsquo;s
experiments it was only about 2 volts. This kind of discharge is
determined not by the condition that the potential difference
should have a given value, but that the electric force should have
a given value. Another point in which this discharge differs from
the ordinary one is that it is influenced entirely by the nature
of the electrodes and not by the nature or pressure of the gas
between them, whereas the ordinary discharge is in many cases
not affected appreciably by changes in the metal of the electrodes,
but is always affected by changes in the pressure and character
of the gas between them. Kinsley found that when one of these
small sparks passed between the electrodes a kind of metallic
bridge was formed between them, so that they were in metallic
connexion, and that the distance between them had to be
considerably increased before the bridge was broken. Almy
(<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, Sept. 1908), who used very small electrodes, was
unable to get a discharge with less than the minimum spark
potential even when the spark length was reduced to one-third of
the wave length of sodium light. He suggests that the discharges
obtained with larger electrodes for smaller voltages are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page883" id="page883"></a>883</span>
due to the electrodes being dragged together by the electrostatic
attraction between them.</p>

<p><i>Constitution of the Electric Spark.</i>&mdash;Schuster and Hemsalech
(<i>Phil. Trans.</i> 193, p. 189), Hemsalech (<i>Comptes Rendus</i>, 130, p.
898; 132, p. 917; <i>Jour. de Phys.</i> 3. 9, p. 43, and Schenck, <i>Astrophy.
Jour.</i> 14, p. 116) have by spectroscopic methods obtained very
interesting results about the constitution of the spark. The
method employed by Schuster and Hemsalech was as follows:
Suppose we photograph the spectrum of a horizontal spark on a
film which is on the rim of a wheel rotating about a horizontal
axis with great velocity. If the luminosity travelled with
infinite speed from one electrode to the other, the image on the
film would be a horizontal line. If, however, the speed with
which the luminosity travelled between the electrodes was
comparable with the speed of the film, the line would be inclined
to the horizontal, and by measuring the inclinations we could
find the speed at which the luminosity travelled. In this way
Schuster and Hemsalech showed that when an oscillating
discharge passed between metallic terminals in air, the first spark
passes through the air alone, no lines of the metal appearing in
its spectrum. This first spark vaporizes some of the metal and
the subsequent sparks passing mainly through the metallic
vapour; the appearance of the lines in the film shows that the
velocity of the luminous part of the vapour was finite. The
velocity of the vapour of metals of low atomic weight was in
general greater than that of the vapour of heavier metals.
Thus the velocity of aluminium vapour was 1890 metres per
second, that of zinc and cadmium only about 545. Perhaps the
most interesting point in the investigation was the discovery that
the velocities corresponding to different lines in the spectrum of
the same metal were in some cases different. Thus with bismuth
some of the lines indicated a velocity of 1420 metres per second,
others a velocity of only 550, while one (&lambda; = 3793) showed
a still smaller velocity. These results are in accordance with a
view suggested by other phenomena that many of the lines in a
spectrum produced by an electrical discharge originate from
systems formed during the discharge and not from the normal
atom or molecule. Schuster and Hemsalech found that by
inserting a coil with large self induction in the primary circuit
they could obliterate the air lines in the discharge.</p>

<p>Schenck, by observing the appearance presented when an
alternating current, produced by discharging Leyden jars, was
examined in a rapidly rotating mirror, found it showed the
following stages: (1) a thin bright line, followed in some cases at
intervals of half the period of the discharge by fainter lines; (2)
bright curved streamers starting from the negative terminal, and
diminishing rapidly in speed as they receded from the cathode;
(3) a diffused glow lasting for a much longer period than either
of the preceding. These constituents gave out quite different
spectra.</p>

<p>The structure of the discharge is much more easily studied
when the pressure of the gas is low, as the various parts which
make up the discharge are more widely separated from each other.
We have already described the general appearance of the discharge
through gases at low pressures (see p. 657). There is,
however, one form of discharge which is so striking and beautiful
that it deserves more detailed consideration. In this type of
discharge, known as the striated discharge, the positive column
is made up of alternate bright and dark patches known as
<i>striations</i>. Some of these are represented in fig. 17, which is
taken from a paper by De la Rue and Müller (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1878,
Pt. 1). This type of discharge only occurs when the current and
the pressure of the gas are between certain limits. It is most
beautifully shown when a Wehnelt cathode is used and the
current is produced by storage cells, as this allows us to use large
currents and to maintain a steady potential difference between the
electrodes. The striations are in consequence very bright and
steady. The facts which have been established about these
striations are as follows: The distance between the bright parts
of the striations is greater at low pressures than at high; it
depends also upon the diameter of the tube, increasing as the
diameter of the tube increases. If the discharge tube is wide at
one place and narrow in another the striations will be closer
together in the narrow parts than in the wide. The distance
between the striations depends on the current through the tube.
The relation is not a very simple one, as an increase of current
sometimes increases while under other circumstances it decreases
the distance between the striations (see Willows, <i>Proc. Camb.
Phil. Soc.</i> 10, p. 302). The electric force is not uniform along the
striated discharge, but is greater in the bright than in the dark
parts of the striation. An example is shown in fig. 16, due to H.
A. Wilson, which shows the distribution of electric force at every
place in a striated discharge. In experiments made by J. J.
Thomson (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, Oct. 1909), using a Wehnelt cathode, the
variations in the electric force were more pronounced than those
shown in fig. 16. The electric force in this case changed so greatly
that it actually became negative just on the cathode side of the
bright part of the striation. Just inside the striation on the anode
side it rose to a very high value, then continually diminished
towards the bright side of the next striation when it again
increased. This distribution of electric force implies that there
is great excess of negative electricity at the bright head of the
striation, and a small excess of positive everywhere else. The
temperature of the gas is higher in the bright than in the dark
parts of the striations. Wood (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 49, p. 238), who has
made a very careful study of the distribution of temperature in
a discharge tube, finds that in those tubes the temperature varies
in the same way as the electric force, but that this temperature
(which it must be remembered is the average temperature of all
the molecules and not merely of those which are taking part in
the discharge) is by no means high; in no part of the discharge
did the temperature in his experiments exceed 100° C.</p>

<p><i>Theory of the Striations.</i>&mdash;We may regard the heaping up of
the negative charges at intervals along the discharge as the
fundamental feature in the striations, and this heaping up may
be explained as follows. Imagine a corpuscle projected with
considerable velocity from a place where the electric field is
strong, such as the neighbourhood of the cathode; as it moves
towards the anode through the gas it will collide with the molecules,
ionize them and lose energy and velocity. Thus unless
the corpuscle is acted on by a field strong enough to supply it
with the energy it loses by collision, its speed will gradually
diminish. Further, when its energy falls below a certain value
it will unite with a molecule and become part of a negative ion,
instead of a corpuscle; at this stage there will be a sudden and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page884" id="page884"></a>884</span>
very large diminution in its velocity. Let us now follow the
course of a stream of corpuscles starting from the cathode and
approaching the anode. If the speed falls off as the stream
proceeds, the corpuscles in the rear will gain on those in front
and the density of the stream in the front will be increased.
If at a certain place the velocity receives a sudden check by the
corpuscles becoming loaded with a molecule, the density of the
negative electricity will increase at this place with great rapidity,
and here there will be a great accumulation of negative electricity,
as at the bright head on the cathode side of a striation. Now
this accumulation of negative electricity will produce a large
electric force on the anode side; this will drive corpuscles
forward with great velocity and ionize the gas. These corpuscles
will behave like those shot from the cathode and will accumulate
again at some distance from their origin, forming the bright
head of the next striation, when the process will be repeated.
On this view the bright heads of the striations act like electrodes,
and the discharge passes from one bright head to the next as by
a number of stepping stones, and not directly from cathode
to anode. The luminosity at the head of the striations is due
to the recombination of the ions. These ions have acquired
considerable energy from the electric field, and this energy will
be available for supplying the energy radiated away as light.
The recombination of ions which do not possess considerable
amounts of energy does not seem to give rise to luminosity.
Thus, in an ionized gas not exposed to an electric field, although
we have recombination between the ions, we need not have
luminosity. We have at present no exact data as to the amount
of energy which must be given to an ion to make it luminous
on recombination; it also certainly varies with the nature of
the ion; thus even with hot Wehnelt cathodes J. J. Thomson
has never been able to make the discharge through air luminous
with a potential less than from 16 to 17 volts. The mercury
lamps, however, in which the discharge passes through mercury
vapour are luminous with a potential difference of about 12
volts. It follows that if the preceding theory be right the
potential difference between two bright striations must be
great enough to make the corpuscles ionize by collision and also
to give enough energy to the ions to make them luminous when
they recombine. The difference of potential between the bright
parts of successive striations has been measured by Hohn (<i>Phys.
Zeit.</i> 9, p. 558); it varies with the pressure and with the gas.
The smallest value given by Hohn is about 15 volts. In some
experiments made by J. J. Thomson, when the pressure of the
gas was very low, the difference of potential between two adjacent
dark spaces was as low as 3.75 volts.</p>

<p><i>The Arc Discharge.</i>&mdash;The discharges we have hitherto considered
have been characterized by large potential differences
and small currents. In the arc discharge we get very large
currents with comparatively small potential differences. We
may get the arc discharge by taking a battery of cells large
enough to give a potential difference of 60 to 80 volts, and
connecting the cells with two carbon terminals, which are put
in contact, so that a current of electricity flows round the circuit.
If the terminals, while the current is on, are drawn apart, a
bright discharge, which may carry a current of many amperes,
passes from one to the other. This arc discharge, as it is called, is
characterized by intense heat and by the brilliant luminosity
of the terminals. This makes it a powerful source of light.
The temperature of the positive terminal is much higher than
that of the negative. According to Violle (<i>Comptes Rendus</i>,
115, p. 1273) the temperature of the tip of the former is about
3500° C, and that of the latter 2700° C. The temperature of the
arc itself he found to be higher than that of either of its terminals.
As the arc passes, the positive terminal gets hollowed out into
a crater-like shape, but the negative terminal remains pointed.
Both terminals lose weight.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The appearance of the terminals is shown in fig. 18, given by Mrs
Ayrton (<i>Proc. Inst. Elec. Eng.</i> 28, p. 400); a, b represent the terminals
when the arc is quiet, and c when it is accompanied by a hissing sound.
The intrinsic brightness of the positive crater does not increase with
an increase in the current; an increased current produces an increase
in the area of the luminous crater, but the amount of light given
out by each unit of area of luminous surface is unaltered. This
indicates that the temperature of the crater is constant; it is
probably that at which carbon volatilizes. W. E. Wilson (<i>Proc.
Roy. Soc.</i> 58, p. 174; 60, p. 377) has shown that at pressures of
several atmospheres the intrinsic brightness of the crater is considerably
diminished.</p>

<p>The connexion between V, the potential difference between the
terminals, and l, the length of the arc, is somewhat analogous to
that which holds for the spark discharge. Fröhlich (<i>Electrotech. Zeit.</i>
4, p. 150) gives for this connexion the relation V = m + nl, where
m and n are constants. Mrs Ayrton (<i>The Electric Arc</i>, chap. iv.)
finds that both m and n depend upon the current passing between
the terminals, and gives as the relation between V and l,
V = &alpha; + &beta;/I + (&gamma; + &delta;/I)l,
where &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, &delta; are constants and I the current.
The relation between current and potential difference was made the
subject of a series of experiments by Ayrton (<i>Electrician</i>, 1, p. 319;
xi. p. 418), some of whose results are represented in fig. 19. For a
quiet arc an increase in current is accompanied by a fall in potential
difference, while for the hissing arc the potential difference is independent
of the current. The quantities m and n which occur in
Fröhlich&rsquo;s equation have been determined by several experimenters.
For carbon electrodes in air at atmospheric pressure m is about 39
volts, varying somewhat with the size and purity of the carbons;
it is diminished by soaking the terminals in salt solution. The
value of n given by different observers varies considerably, ranging
from .76 to 2 volts when l is measured in millimetres; it depends
upon the current, diminishing as the current increases. When
metallic terminals are used instead of carbons, the value of m
depends upon the nature of the metal, m in general being larger
the higher the temperature at which the metal volatilizes. Thus
v. Lang (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 31, p. 384) found the following values for m in
air at atmospheric pressure:&mdash;C = 35; Pt = 27.4; Fe = 25; Ni = 26.18;
Cu = 23.86; Ag = 15.23; Zn = 19.86; Cd = 10.28. Lecher (<i>Wied.
Ann.</i> 33, p. 609) gives Pt = 28, Fe = 20, Ag = 8, while Arons (<i>Wied.
Ann.</i> 31, p. 384) found for Hg the value 12.8; in this case the fall of
potential along the arc itself was abnormally small. In comparing
these values it is important to remember that Lecher (loc. cit.) has
shown that with Fe or Pt terminals the arc discharge is intermittent.
Arons has shown that this is also the case with Hg terminals, but
no intermittence has been detected with terminals of C, Ag or Cu.
The preceding measurements refer to mean potentials, and no
conclusions as to the actual potential differences at any time can be
drawn when the discharge is discontinuous, unless we know the law
of discontinuity. The ease with which an arc is sustained depends
greatly on the nature of the electrodes; when they are brass, zinc,
cadmium, or magnesium it is exceedingly difficult to get the arc.</p>

<p>The potential difference between the terminals is affected by the
pressure of the gas. The most extensive series of experiments on
this point is that made by Duncan, Rowland, and Tod (<i>Electrician</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page885" id="page885"></a>885</span>
31, p. 60), whose results are represented in fig. 20. We see from
these curves that for very short arcs the potential difference increases
continuously with the pressure, but for longer ones there is a critical
pressure at which the potential difference is a minimum, and that
this critical pressure seems to increase with the length of arc.
The nature of the gas also affects the potential difference. The
magnitude of this effect may be gathered from the following values
given by Arons (<i>Ann. der Phys.</i> 1, p. 700) for the potential difference
required to produce an arc 1.5 mm. long, carrying a current of 4.5
amperes, between terminals of different metals in air and pure
nitrogen.</p>

<p class="noind">Thus, with the discharge for an arc of given length and current,
the nature of the terminals is the most important factor in determining
the potential difference. The effects produced by the pressure
and nature of the surrounding gas, although quite appreciable, are
not of so much importance, while in the spark discharge the nature
of the terminals is of no importance, everything depending upon
the nature and pressure of the gas.</p>

<p>The potential gradient in the arc is very far from being uniform.
With carbon terminals Luggin (<i>Wien. Ber.</i> 98, p. 1192) found that,
with a current of 15 amperes, there was a fall of potential of 33.7
close to the anode, and one 8.7 close to the cathode, so that the curve
representing the distribution of potential between the terminals
would be somewhat like that shown in fig. 21. We have seen that a
somewhat analogous distribution of potential holds in the case of
conduction through flames, though in that case the greatest drop of
potential is in general at the cathode and not at the anode. The
difference between the changes of potential at the anode and cathode
is not so large with Fe and Cu terminals as with carbon ones;
with mercury terminals, Arons (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 58, p. 73) found the anode
fall to be 7.4 volts, the cathode fall 5.4 volts.</p>
</div>

<p>The case of the arc when the cathode is a pool of mercury and
the anode a metal wire placed in a vessel from which the air has
been exhausted is one which has attracted much attention, and
important investigations on this point have been made by
Hewitt (<i>Electrician</i>, 52, p. 447), Wills (<i>Electrician</i>, 54, p. 26),
Stark, Retschinsky and Schnaposnikoff (<i>Ann. der Phys.</i> 18,
p. 213) and Pollak (<i>Ann. der Phys.</i> 19, p. 217). In this arrangement
the mercury is vaporized by the heat, and the discharge
which passes through the mercury vapour gives an exceedingly
bright light, which has been largely used for lighting factories, &amp;c.
The arrangement can also be used as a rectifier, for a current
will only pass through it when the mercury pool is the cathode.
Thus if such a lamp is connected with an alternating current
circuit, it lets through the current in one direction and stops
that in the other, thus furnishing a current which is always in
one direction.</p>

<p><i>Theory of the Arc Discharge.</i>&mdash;An incandescent body such
as a piece of carbon even when at a temperature far below that
of the terminals in an arc, emits corpuscles at a rate corresponding
to a current of the order of 1 ampere per square centimetre of
incandescent surface, and as the rate of increase of emission
with the temperature is very rapid, it is probably at the rate
of many amperes per square centimetre at the temperature of
the negative carbon in the arc. If then a piece of carbon were
maintained at this temperature by some external means, and
used as a cathode, a current could be sent from it to another
electrode whether the second electrode were cold or hot. If,
however, these negatively electrified corpuscles did not produce
other ions either by collision with the gas through which they
move or with the anode, the spaces between cathode and anode
would have a negative charge, which would tend to stop the
corpuscles leaving the cathode and would require a large potential
difference between anode and cathode to produce any considerable
current. If, however, there is ionization either in the gas
or at the anode, the positive ions will diffuse into the region of
the discharge until they are sensibly equal in number to the
negative ions. When this is the case the back electromotive
force is destroyed and the same potential difference will carry
a much larger current. The arc discharge may be regarded as
analogous to the discharge between incandescent terminals,
the only difference being that in the arc the terminals are maintained
in the state of incandescence by the current and not by
external means. On this view the cathode is bombarded by
positive ions which heat it to such a temperature that negative
corpuscles sufficient to carry the current are emitted by it.
These corpuscles bombard the anode and keep it incandescent.
They ionize also, either directly by collision or indirectly by
heating the anode, the gas and vapour of the metal of which
the anode is made, and produce in this way the supply of positive
ions which keep the cathode hot.</p>

<p><i>Discharge from a Point.</i>&mdash;A very interesting case of electric
discharge is that between a sharply pointed electrode, such as a
needle, and a metal surface of considerable area. At atmospheric
pressures the luminosity is confined to the immediate neighbourhood
of the point. If the sign of the potential of the point does
not change, the discharge is carried by ions of one sign&mdash;that of
the charge on the pointed electrode. The velocity of these ions
under a given potential gradient has been measured by Chattock
(<i>Phil. Mag.</i> 32, p. 285), and found to agree with that of the ions
produced by Röntgen or uranium radiation, while Townsend
(<i>Phil. Trans.</i> 195, p. 259) has shown that the charge on these
ions is the same as that on the ions streaming from the point.
If the pointed electrode be placed at right angles to a metal plane
serving as the other electrode, the discharge takes place when, for
a given distance of the point from the plane, the potential
difference between the electrodes exceeds a definite value
depending upon the pressure and nature of the gas through which
the discharge passes; its value also depends upon whether,
beginning with a small potential difference, we gradually increase
it until discharge commences, or, beginning with a large potential
difference, we decrease it until the discharge stops. The value
found by the latter method is less than that by the former.
According to Chattock&rsquo;s measurements the potential difference V
for discharge between the point and the plate is given by the
linear relation V = a + bl, where l is the distance of the point from
the plate and a and b are constants. From v. Obermayer&rsquo;s
(<i>Wien. Ber.</i> 100, 2, p. 127) experiments, in which the distance l
was greater than in Chattock&rsquo;s, it would seem that the potential
for larger distances does not increase quite so rapidly with l as
is indicated by Chattock&rsquo;s relation. The potential required to
produce this discharge is much less than that required to produce
a spark of length l between parallel plates; thus from Chattock&rsquo;s
experiments to produce the point discharge when l = .5 cm. in air
at atmospheric pressure requires a potential difference of about
3800 volts when the pointed electrode is positive, while to
produce a spark at the same distance between plane electrodes
would require a potential difference of about 15,000 volts.
Chattock showed that with the same pointed electrode the value
of the electric intensity at the point was the same whatever the
distance of the point from the plane. The value of the electric
intensity depended upon the sharpness of the point. When the
end of the pointed electrode is a hemisphere of radius a, Chattock
showed that for the same gas at the same pressure the electric
intensity &int; when discharge takes place is roughly proportioned to
a<span class="sp">&minus;0.8</span>. The value of the electric intensity at the pointed electrode
is much greater than its value at a plane electrode for long
sparks; but we must remember that at a distance from a
pointed electrode equal to a small multiple of the radius of
curvature of its extremity the electric intensity falls very far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page886" id="page886"></a>886</span>
below that required to produce discharge in a uniform field, so
that the discharge from a pointed electrode ought to be compared
with a spark whose length is comparable with the radius of
curvature of the point. For such short sparks the electric
intensity is very high. The electric intensity required to produce
the discharge from a gas diminishes as the pressure of the gas
diminishes, but not nearly so rapidly as the electric intensity for
long sparks. Here again the discharge from a point is comparable
with short sparks, which, as we have seen, are much less sensitive
to pressure changes than longer ones. The minimum potential at
which the electricity streams from the point does not depend
upon the material of which the point is made; it varies, however,
considerably with the nature of the gas. The following are the
results of some experiments on this point. Those in the first two
columns are due to Röntgen, those in the third and fourth to
Precht:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">We see from this table that in the case of the discharge from a
positively electrified point the greater the molecular weight of the
gas the greater the potential required for discharge. Röntgen
concluded from his experiments that the discharging potential
from a positive point in different gases at the same pressure
varies inversely as the mean free path of the molecules of the gas.
In the same gas, however, at different pressures the discharging
potential does not vary so quickly with the pressure as does the
mean free path. In Precht&rsquo;s experiments, in which different
gases were used, the variations in the discharging potential
are not so great as the variations in the mean free path of the
gases.</p>

<p>The current of electrified air flowing from the point when the
electricity is escaping&mdash;the well-known &ldquo;electrical wind&rdquo;&mdash;is
accompanied by a reaction on the point which tends to drive it
backwards. This reaction has been measured by Arrhenius
(<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 63, p. 305), who finds that when positive electricity is
escaping from a point in air the reaction on the point for a given
current varies inversely as the pressure of the gas, and for
different gases (air, hydrogen and carbonic acid) inversely as the
square root of the molecular weight of the gas. The reaction
when negative electricity is escaping is much less. The proportion
between the reactions for positive and negative currents depends
on the pressure of the gas. Thus for equal positive and negative
currents in air at a pressure of 70 cm. the reaction for a positive
point was 1.9 times that of a negative one, at 40 cm. pressure
2.6 times, at 20 cm. pressure 3.2 times, at 10.3 cm. pressure 7
times, and at 5.1 cm. pressure 15 times the reaction for the
negative point. Investigation shows that the reaction should
be proportional to the quotient of the current by the velocity
acquired by an ion under unit potential gradient. Now this
velocity is inversely proportional to the pressure, so that the
reaction should on this view be directly proportional to the
pressure. This agrees with Arrhenius&rsquo; results when the point is
positive. Again, the velocities of an ion in hydrogen, air and
carbonic acid at the same pressure are approximately inversely
proportional to the square roots of their molecular weights, so
that the reaction should be directly proportional to this quantity.
This also agrees with Arrhenius&rsquo; results for the discharge from a
positive point. The velocity of the negative ion is greater than
that of a positive one under the same potential gradient, so that
the reaction for the negative point should be less than that for a
positive one, but the excess of the positive reaction over the
negative is much greater than that of the velocity of the negative
ion over the velocity of the positive. There is, however, reason to
believe that a considerable condensation takes place around the
negative ion as a nucleus after it is formed, so that the velocity of
the negative ion under a given potential gradient will be greater
immediately after the ion is formed than when it has existed for
some time. The measurements which have been made of the
velocities of the ions relate to those which have been some time in
existence, but a large part of the reaction will be due to the
newly-formed ions moving with a greater velocity, and thus
giving a smaller reaction than that calculated from the observed
velocity.</p>

<p>With a given potential difference between the point and the
neighbouring conductor the current issuing from the point is
greater when the point is negative than when it is positive, except
in oxygen, when it is less. Warburg (<i>Sitz. Akad. d. Wissensch.
zu Berlin</i>, 1899, 50, p. 770) has shown that the addition of a
small quantity of oxygen to nitrogen produces a great diminution
in the current from a negative point, but has very little effect on
the discharge from a positive point. Thus the removal of a trace
of oxygen made a leak from a negative point 50 times what it was
before. Experiments with hydrogen and helium showed that
impurities in these gases had a great effect on the current when
the point was negative, and but little when it was positive. This
suggests that the impurities, by condensing round the negative
ions as nuclei, seriously diminish their velocity. If a point is
charged up to a high and rapidly alternating potential, such as
can be produced by the electric oscillations started when a Leyden
jar is discharged, then in hydrogen, nitrogen, ammonia and
carbonic acid gas a conductor placed in the neighbourhood of the
point gets a negative charge, while in air and oxygen it gets a
positive one. There are two considerations which are of importance
in connexion with this effect. The first is the velocity of
the ions in the electric field, and the second the ease with which
the ions can give up their charges to the metal point. The greater
velocity of the negative ions would, if the potential were rapidly
alternating, cause an excess of negative ions to be left in the
surrounding gas. This is the case in hydrogen. If, however, the
metal had a much greater tendency to unite with negative than
with positive ions, such as we should expect to be the case in
oxygen, this would act in the opposite direction, and tend to
leave an excess of positive ions in the gas.</p>

<p><i>The Characteristic Curve for Discharge through Gases.</i>&mdash;When
a current of electricity passes through a metallic conductor the
relation between the current and the potential difference is the
exceedingly simple one expressed by Ohm&rsquo;s law; the current
is proportional to the potential difference. When the current
passes through a gas there is no such simple relation. Thus we
have already mentioned cases where the current increased as the
potential increased although not in the same proportion, while
as we have seen in certain stages of the arc discharge the potential
difference diminishes as the current increases. Thus the problem
of finding the current which a given battery will produce when
part of the circuit consists of a gas discharge is much more
complicated than when the circuit consists entirely of metallic
conductors. If, however, we measure the potential difference
between the electrodes in the gas when different currents are
sent through it, we can plot a curve, called the &ldquo;characteristic
curve,&rdquo; whose ordinates are the potential differences between
the electrodes in the gas and the abscissae the corresponding
currents. By the aid of this curve we can calculate the current
produced when a given battery is connected up to the gas by
leads of known resistance.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For let E<span class="su">0</span> be the electromotive force of the battery, R the resistance
of the leads, i the current, the potential difference between
the terms in the gas will be E<span class="su">0</span> &minus; Ri. Let ABC (fig. 22) be the
&ldquo;characteristic curve,&rdquo; the ordinates being the potential difference
between the terminals in the gas, and the abscissae the current.
Draw the line LM whose equation is  E = E<span class="su">0</span> &minus; Ri,  then the points
where this line cuts the characteristic curves will give possible
values of i and E, the current through the discharge tube and the
potential difference between the terminals. Some of these points
may, however, correspond to an unstable position and be impossible
to realize. The following method gives us a criterion by which we
can distinguish the stable from the unstable positions. If the current
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page887" id="page887"></a>887</span>
is increased by &delta;i, the electromotive force which has to be overcome
by the battery is R&delta;i + (dE/di)&delta;i. If R + dE/di is positive there will
be an unbalanced electromotive force round the circuit tending to
stop the current. Thus the increase in the current will be stopped
and the condition will be a stable one. If, however, R + dE/di is
negative there will be an unbalanced
electromotive force
tending to increase the current
still further; thus the current
will go on increasing and the
condition will be unstable.
Thus for stability R + dE/di
must be positive, a condition
first given by Kaufmann (<i>Ann.
der Phys.</i> 11, p. 158). The
geometrical interpretation of
this condition is that the
straight line LM must, at the
point where it cuts the characteristic
curve, be steeper
than the tangent to characteristic
curve. Thus of the points
ABC where the line cuts the curve in fig. 22, A and C correspond
to stable states and B to an unstable one. The state of things
represented by a point P on the characteristic curve when the slope
is downward cannot be stable unless there is in the external circuit
a resistance greater than that represented by the tangent of the
inclination of the tangent to the curve at P to the horizontal axis.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: left; width: 330px;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption sc">Fig. 22.</td></tr></table>

<p>If we keep the external electromotive force the same and gradually
increase the resistance in the leads, the line LM will become steeper
and steeper. C will move to the left so that the current will diminish;
when the line gets so steep that it touches the curve at C&rsquo;, any
further increase in the resistance will produce an abrupt change in
the current; for now the state of things represented by a point near
A&rsquo; is the only stable state. Thus if the BC part of the curve corresponded
to a luminous discharge and the A part to a dark discharge,
we see that if the electromotive force is kept constant there is a
minimum value of the current for the luminous discharge. If the
current is reduced below this value, the discharge ceases to be
luminous, and there is an abrupt diminution in the current.</p>
</div>

<p style="clear: both;"><i>Cathode Rays.</i>&mdash;When the gas in the discharge tube is at a
very low pressure some remarkable phenomena occur in the
neighbourhood of the cathode. These seem to have been first
observed by Plücker (<i>Pogg. Ann.</i> 107, p. 77; 116, p. 45) who
noticed on the walls of the glass tube near the cathode a greenish
phosphorescence, which he regarded as due to rays proceeding
from the cathode, striking against the sides of the tube, and then
travelling back to the cathode. He found that the action of a
magnet on these rays was not the same as the action on the
part of the discharge near the positive electrode. Hittorf (<i>Pogg.
Ann.</i> 136, p. 8) showed that the agent producing the phosphorescence
was intercepted by a solid, whether conductor or insulator,
placed between the cathode and the sides of the tube. He
regarded the phosphorescence as caused by a motion starting
from the cathode and travelling in straight lines through the gas.
Goldstein (<i>Monat. der Berl. Akad.</i>, 1876, p. 24) confirmed this
discovery of Hittorf&rsquo;s, and further showed that a distinct,
though not very sharp, shadow is cast by a small object placed
near a large plane cathode. This is a proof that the rays producing
the phosphorescence must be emitted almost normally
from the cathode, and not, like the rays of light from a luminous
surface, in all directions, for such rays would not produce a
perceptible shadow if a small body were placed near the plane.
Goldstein regarded the phosphorescence as due to waves in the
ether, for whose propagation the gas was not necessary. Crookes
(<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1879, pt. i. p. 135; pt. ii. pp. 587, 661), who made
many remarkable researches in this subject, took a different
view. He regarded the rays as streams of negatively electrified
particles projected normally from the cathode with great velocity,
and, when the pressure is sufficiently low, reaching the sides of
the tube, and by their impact producing phosphorescence and
heat. The rays on this view are deflected by a magnet, because
a magnet exerts a force on a charged moving body.</p>

<p>These rays striking against glass make it phosphorescent.
The colour of the phosphorescence depends on the kind of glass;
thus the light from soda glass is a yellowish green, and that from
lead glass blue. Many other bodies phosphoresce when exposed
to these rays, and in particular the phosphorescence of some
gems, such as rubies and diamonds, is exceedingly vivid. The
spectrum of the phosphorescent light is generally continuous,
but Crookes showed that the phosphorescence of some of the
rare earths, such as yttrium, gives a spectrum of bright bands,
and he founded on this fact a spectroscopic method of great
importance. Goldstein (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 54, p. 371) discovered
that the haloid salts of the alkali metals change colour under
the rays, sodium chloride, for example, becoming violet. The
coloration is a surface one, and has been traced by E. Wiedemann
and Schmidt (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 54, p. 618) to the formation of a subchloride.
Chlorides of tin, mercury and lead also change colour in
the same way. E. Wiedemann (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 56, p. 201) discovered
another remarkable effect, which he called thermo-luminescence;
he found that many bodies after being exposed to the cathode
rays possess for some time the power of becoming luminous
when their temperature is raised to a point far below that at
which they become luminous in the normal state. Substances
belonging to the class called by van &rsquo;t Hoff solid solutions exhibit
this property of thermo-luminescence to a remarkable extent.
They are formed when two salts, one greatly in excess of the
other, are simultaneously precipitated from a solution. A trace
of MnSO<span class="su">4</span> in CaSO<span class="su">4</span> shows very brilliant thermo-luminescence.
The impact of cathode rays produces after a time perceptible
changes in the glass. Crookes (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> pt. ii. 1879, p. 645)
found that after glass has been phosphorescing for some time
under the cathode rays it seems to get tired, and the phosphorescence
is not so
bright as it was
initially. Thus, for
example, when the
shadow of a Maltese
cross is thrown
on the walls of the
tube as in fig. 23,
if after the discharge
has been
going on for some
time the cross is
shaken down or a
new cathode used
whose line of fire does not cut the cross, the pattern of the cross
will still be seen on the glass, but it will now be brighter instead
of darker than the surrounding portion. The portions shielded
by the cross, not being tired by being made to phosphoresce
for a long time, respond more vigorously to the stimulus than
those portions which have not been protected. Skinner (<i>Proc.
Camb. Phil. Soc.</i> ix. p. 371) and Thomson found on the glass
which had been exposed to the rays gelatinous filaments, apparently
silica, resulting from the reduction of the glass. A reducing
action was also noticed by Villard (<i>Journ. de phys.</i> 3, viii.
p. 140) and Wehnelt (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 67, p. 421). It can be well
shown by letting the rays fall on a plate of oxidized copper,
when the part struck by the rays will become bright. The
rays heat bodies on which they fall, and if they are concentrated
by using as a cathode a portion of a spherical surface, the heat
at the centre becomes so great that a piece of platinum wire can
be melted or a diamond charred. Measurements of the heating
effects of the rays have been made by Thomson (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>
[5], 44, p. 293) and Cady (<i>Ann. der Phys.</i> 1, p. 678). Crookes
(<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1879, pt. i. p. 152) showed that a vane mounted
as in a radiometer is set in rotation by the rays, the direction of
the rotation being the same as would be produced by a stream
of particles proceeding from the cathode. The movement is
not due to the momentum imparted to the vanes by the rays,
but to the difference in temperature between the sides of the
vanes, the rays making the side against which they strike
hotter than the other.</p>

<p><i>Effect of a Magnet.</i>&mdash;The rays are deflected by a magnet,
so that the distribution of phosphorescence over the glass and
the shape and position of the shadows cast by bodies in the tube
are altered by the proximity of a magnet. The laws of magnetic
deflection of these rays have been investigated by Plücker (<i>Pogg.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page888" id="page888"></a>888</span>
<i>Ann.</i> 103, p. 88), Hittorf (<i>Pogg. Ann.</i> 136, p. 213), Crookes (<i>Phil.
Trans.</i>, 1879, pt. 1, p. 557), and Schuster (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> 47, p.
526). The deflection is the same as that of negatively electrified
particles travelling along the path of the rays. Such particles
would in a magnetic field be acted on by a force at right angles
to the direction of motion of the particle and also to the magnetic
force, the magnitude of the force being proportional to the
product of the velocity of the particle, the magnetic force, and
the sine of the angle between these vectors. In this case we have
seen that if the particle is not acted on by an electrostatic field,
the path in a uniform magnetic field is a spiral, which, if the
magnetic force is at right angles to the direction of projection
of the particle, becomes a circle in the plane at right angles to
the magnetic force, the radius being mv/He, where m, v, e are
respectively the mass, velocity and charge on the particle, and
H is the magnetic force. The smaller the difference of potential
between the electrodes of the discharge tube the greater the
deflection produced by a magnetic field of given strength, and as
the difference of potential rapidly increases with diminution of
pressure, after a certain pressure has been passed, the higher
the exhaustion of the tube the less the magnetic deflection of
the rays. Birkeland (<i>Comptes rendus</i>, 1896, p. 492) has shown
that when the discharge is from an induction coil the cathode
rays produced in the tube at any one time are not equally
deflected by a magnet, but that a narrow patch of phosphorescence
when deflected by a magnet is split up into several distinct
patches, giving rise to what Birkeland calls the &ldquo;magnetic
spectrum.&rdquo; Strutt (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> 48, p. 478) has shown that this
magnetic spectrum does not occur if the discharge of a large
number of cells is employed instead of the coil. Thomson (<i>Proc.
Camb. Phil. Soc.</i> 9, p. 243) has shown that if the potential
difference between the electrodes is kept the same the magnetic
deflection is independent of the nature of the gas filling the
discharge tube; this was tested with gases so different as air,
hydrogen, carbonic acid and methyl iodide.</p>

<p><i>Charge of Negative Electricity carried by the Rays.</i>&mdash;We have
seen that the rays are deflected by a magnet, as if they were
particles charged with negative electricity. Perrin (<i>Comptes
rendus</i>, 121, p. 1130) showed by direct experiment that a stream
of negative electricity is associated with the rays. A modification
made by Thomson of Perrin&rsquo;s experiment is sketched in
fig. 24 (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> 48, p. 478).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The rays start from the cathode A, and pass through a slit in a
solid brass rod B fitting tightly into the neck of the tube. This
rod is connected with earth and used as the anode. The rays after
passing through the slit travel through the vessel C. D and E are
two insulated metal cylinders
insulated from each other,
and each having a slit cut in
its face so as to enable the
rays to pass into the inside of
the inner cylinder, which is
connected with an electrometer,
the outer cylinder
being connected with the
earth. The two cylinders are
placed on the far side of the
vessel, but out of the direct
line of fire of the rays. When
the rays go straight through
the slit there is only a very
small negative charge communicated
to the inner
cylinder, but when they are
deflected by a magnet so that
the phosphorescent patch falls
on the slit in the outer
cylinder the inner cylinder
receives a very large negative
charge, the increase coinciding
very sharply with the appearance of the phosphorescent patch on the
slit. When the patch is so much deflected by the magnet that it
falls below the slit, the negative charge in the cylinder again disappears.
This experiment shows that the cathode rays are accompanied
by a stream of negative electrification. The same apparatus
can be used to show that the passage of cathode rays through a
gas makes it a conductor of electricity. For if the induction coil is
kept running and a stream of the rays kept steadily going into the
inner cylinder, the potential of the inner cylinder reaches a definite
negative value below which it does not fall, however long the rays
may be kept going. The cylinder reaches a steady state in which
the gain of negative electricity from the cathode rays is equal to the
loss by leakage through the conducting gas, the conductivity being
produced by the passage of the rays through it. If the inner cylinder
is charged up initially with a greater negative charge than corresponds
to the steady state, on turning the rays on to the cylinder the negative
charge will decrease and not increase until it reaches the steady
state. The conductivity produced by the passage of cathode rays
through a gas diminishes rapidly with the pressure. When rays
pass through a gas at a low pressure, they are deflected by an electric
field; when the pressure of the gas is higher the conductivity it
acquires when the cathode rays pass through it is so large that the
potential gradient cannot reach a sufficiently high value to produce
an appreciable deflection.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity;
the experiment described on page 875 (fig. 13) shows that they
are deflected by an electric field as if they were negatively
electrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the way
this force would act on a negatively electrified body moving
along the path of the rays. There is therefore every reason for
believing that they are charges of negative electricity in rapid
motion. By measuring the deflection produced by magnetic
and electric fields we can determine the velocity with which
these particles moved and the ratio of the mass of the particle
to the charge carried by it.</p>

<p>We may conclude from the experiments that the value of m/e
for the particles constituting the cathode rays is of the order
1/1.7&times;10<span class="sp">7</span>, and we have seen that m/e has the same value in
all the other cases of negative ions in a gas at low pressure for
which it has been measured&mdash;viz. for the ions produced when
ultra-violet light falls on a metal plate, or when an incandescent
carbon filament is surrounded by a gas at a low pressure, and
for the &beta; particles given out by radio-active bodies. We have
also seen that the value of the charge on the gaseous ion, in all
cases in which it has been measured&mdash;viz. the ions produced by
Röntgen and uranium radiation, by ultra-violet light, and by the
discharge of electrification from a point&mdash;is the same in magnitude
as the charge carried by the hydrogen atom in the electrolysis
of solutions. The mass of the hydrogen alone is, however,
10<span class="sp">-4</span> times this charge, while the mass of the carriers of negative
electrification is only 1/1.7&times;10<span class="sp">7</span> times the charge; hence the
mass of the carriers of the negative electrification is only <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1700</span> of
the mass of the hydrogen atom. We are thus, by the study of the
electric discharge, forced to recognize the existence of masses
very much smaller than the smallest mass hitherto recognized.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Direct determinations of the velocity of the cathode rays have
been made by J. J. Thomson (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> 38, p. 358), who measured
the interval between the appearance of phosphorescence on two
pieces of glass placed at a known distance apart, and by Maiorana
(<i>Nuovo Cimento</i>, 4, 6, p. 336) and Battelli and Stefanini (<i>Phys. Zeit.</i>
1, p. 51), who measured the interval between the arrival of the
negative charge carried by the rays at two places separated by a
known distance. The values of the velocity got in this way are much
smaller than the values got by the indirect methods previously
described: thus J. J. Thomson at a fairly high pressure found the
velocity to be 2&times;10<span class="sp">7</span> cm./sec. Maiorana found values ranging
between 10<span class="sp">7</span> and 6&times;10<span class="sp">7</span> cm./sec, and Battelli and Stefanini values
ranging from 6&times;10<span class="sp">6</span> to 1.2&times;10<span class="sp">7</span>. In these methods it is very
difficult to eliminate the effect of the interval which elapses between
the arrival of the rays and the attainment by the means of detection,
such as the phosphorescence of the glass or the deflection of the
electrometer, of sufficient intensity to affect the senses.</p>

<p><i>Transmission of Cathode Rays through Solids&mdash;Lenard Rays.</i>&mdash;It
was for a long time believed that all solids were absolutely
opaque to these rays, as Crookes and Goldstein had proved that
very thin glass, and even a film of collodion, cast intensely black
shadows. Hertz (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 45, p. 28), however, showed that
behind a piece of gold-leaf or aluminium foil an appreciable
amount of phosphorescence occurred on the glass, and that the
phosphorescence moved when a magnet was brought near. A
most important advance was next made by Lenard (<i>Wied. Ann.</i>
51, p. 225), who got the cathode rays to pass from the
inside of a discharge tube to the air outside. For this purpose he
used a tube like that shown in fig. 25. The cathode K is an
aluminium disc 1.2 cm. in diameter fastened to a stiff wire, which
is surrounded by a glass tube. The anode A is a brass strip partly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page889" id="page889"></a>889</span>
surrounding the cathode. The end of the tube in front of the
cathode is closed by a strong metal cap, fastened in with marine
glue, in the middle of which a hole 1.7 mm. in diameter is bored,
and covered with a piece of very thin aluminium foil about
.0026 mm. in thickness. The aluminium window is in metallic
contact with the cap, and this and the anode are connected with
the earth. The tube is then exhausted until the cathode rays
strike against the window. Diffuse light spreads from the
window into the air outside the tube, and can be traced in a dark
room for a distance of several centimetres. From the window,
too, proceed rays which, like the cathode rays, can produce
phosphorescence, for certain bodies phosphoresce when placed
in the neighbourhood of the window. This effect is conveniently
observed by the platino-cryanide screens used to detect Röntgen
radiation. The properties of the rays outside the tube resemble
in all respects those of cathode rays;
they are deflected by a magnet and
by an electric field, they ionize the
gas through which they pass and make
it a conductor of electricity, and they
affect a photographic plate and change
the colour of the haloid salts of
the alkali metals. As, however, it is convenient to distinguish
between cathode rays outside and inside the tube, we shall call
the former Lenard rays. In air at atmospheric pressure the
Lenard rays spread out very diffusely. If the aluminium
window, instead of opening into the air, opens into another tube
which can be exhausted, it is found that the lower the pressure of
the gas in this tube the farther the rays travel and the less diffuse
they are. By filling the tube with different gases Lenard showed
that the greater the density of the gas the greater is the absorption
of these rays. Thus they travel farther in hydrogen than in
any other gas at the same pressure. Lenard showed, too, that if
he adjusted the pressure so that the density of the gas in this tube
was the same&mdash;if, for example, the pressure when the tube was
filled with oxygen was <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> of the pressure when it was filled with
hydrogen&mdash;the absorption was constant whatever the nature of
the gas. Becker (<i>Ann. der Phys.</i> 17, p. 381) has shown that this
law is only approximately true, the absorption by hydrogen
being abnormally large, and by the inert monatomic gases, such
as helium and argon, abnormally small. The distance to which
the Lenard rays penetrate into this tube depends upon the
pressure in the discharge tube; if the exhaustion in the latter is
very high, so that there is a large potential difference between
the cathode and the anode, and therefore a high velocity for the
cathode rays, the Lenard rays will penetrate farther than when
the pressure in the discharge tube is higher and the velocity of the
cathode rays smaller. Lenard showed that the greater the
penetrating power of his rays the smaller was their magnetic
deflection, and therefore the greater their velocity; thus the
greater the velocity of the cathode rays the greater is the velocity
of the Lenard rays to which they give rise. For very slow
cathode rays the absorption by different gases departs altogether
from the density law, so much so that the absorption of these rays
by hydrogen is greater than that by air (Lenard, <i>Ann. der Phys.</i>
12, p. 732). Lenard (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 56, p. 255) studied the passage of
his rays through solids as well as through gases, and arrived at
the very interesting result that the absorption of a substance
depends only upon its density, and not upon its chemical composition
or physical state; in other words, the amount of
absorption of the rays when they traverse a given distance
depends only on the quantity of matter they cut through in the
distance. McClelland (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> 61, p. 227) showed that
the rays carry a charge of negative electricity, and M&rsquo;Lennan
measured the amount of ionization rays of given intensity
produced in different gases, finding that if the pressure is adjusted
so that the density of the different gases is the same the number
of ions per cubic centimetre is also the same. In this case, as
Lenard has shown, the absorption is the same, so that with the
Lenard rays, as with uranium and probably with Röntgen
rays, equal absorption corresponds to equal ionization. A
convenient method for producing Lenard rays of great
intensity has been described by Des Coudres (<i>Wied. Ann.</i>
62, p. 134).</p>

<p><i>Diffuse Reflection of Cathode Rays.</i>&mdash;When cathode rays fall
upon a surface, whether of an insulator or a conductor, cathode
rays start from the surface in all directions. This phenomenon,
which was discovered by Goldstein (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 62, p. 134), has
been investigated by Starke (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 66, p. 49; <i>Ann. der
Phys.</i> 111, p. 75), Austin and Starke (<i>Ann. der Phys.</i> 9, p. 271),
Campbell-Swinton (<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> 64, p. 377), Merritt (<i>Phys.
Rev.</i> 7, p. 217) and Gehrcke (<i>Ann. der Phys.</i> 8, p. 81); it is often
regarded as analogous to the diffuse reflection of light from such
a surface as gypsum, and is spoken of as the diffuse reflection of
the cathode rays. According to Merritt and Austin and Starke
the deviation in a magnetic field of these reflected rays is the same
as that of the incident rays. The experiments, however, were
confined to rays reflected so that the angle of reflection was
nearly equal to that of incidence. Gehrcke showed that among
the reflected rays there were a large number which had a much
smaller velocity than the incident ones. According to Campbell-Swinton
the &ldquo;diffuse&rdquo; reflection is accompanied by a certain
amount of &ldquo;specular&rdquo; reflection. Lenard, who used slower
cathode rays than Austin and Starke, could not detect in the
scattered rays any with velocities comparable with that of the
incident rays; he obtained copious supplies of slow rays whose
speed did not depend on the angle of incidence of the primary
rays (<i>Ann. der Phys.</i> 15, p. 485). When the angle of incidence
is very oblique the surface struck by the rays gets positively
charged, showing that the secondary rays are more numerous
than the primary.</p>

<p><i>Repulsion of two Cathode Streams.</i>&mdash;Goldstein discovered that
if in a tube there are two cathodes connected together, the
cathodic rays from one cathode are deflected when they pass
near the other. Experiments bearing on this subject have been
made by Crookes and Wiedemann and Ebert. The phenomena
may be described by saying that the repulsion of the rays from
a cathode A by a cathode B is only appreciable when the rays
from A pass through the Crookes dark space round B. This is
what we should expect if we remember that the electric field in
the dark space is far stronger than in the rest of the discharge,
and that the gas in the other parts of the tube is rendered a
conductor by the passage through it of the cathode rays, and
therefore incapable of transmitting electrostatic repulsion.</p>

<p>Scattering of the Negative Electrodes.&mdash;In addition to the
cathode rays, portions of metal start normally from the cathode
and form a metallic deposit on the walls of the tube. The
amount of this deposit varies very much with the metal. Crookes
(<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> 50, p. 88) found that the quantities of metal
torn from electrodes of the same size, in equal times, by the
same current, are in the order Pd, Au, Ag, Pb, Sn, Pt, Cu, Cd,
Ni, In, Fe.... In air there is very little deposit from an Al
cathode, but it is abundant in tubes filled with the monatomic
gases, mercury vapour, argon or helium. The scattering
increases as the density of the gas diminishes. The particles
of metal are at low pressures deflected by a magnet, though not
nearly to the same extent as the cathode rays. According to
Grandquist, the loss of weight of the cathode in a given time is
proportional to the square of the current; it is therefore not,
like the loss of the cathode in ordinary electrolysis, proportional
to the quantity of current which passes through it.</p>

<p><i>Positive Rays or &ldquo;Canalstrahlen.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;Goldstein (<i>Berl. Sitzungsb.</i>
39, p. 691) found that with a perforated cathode certain
rays occurred behind the
cathode which were not
appreciably deflected by a
magnet; these he called
Canalstrahlen, but we shall,
for reasons which will appear
later, call them &ldquo;positive
rays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their appearance is well
shown in fig. 26, taken from a paper by Wehnelt (<i>Wied. Ann.</i>
67, p. 421) in which they are represented at B. Goldstein found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page890" id="page890"></a>890</span>
that their colour depends on the gas in which they are
formed, being gold-colour in air and nitrogen, rose-colour in
hydrogen, yellowish rose in oxygen, and greenish gray in
carbonic acid.</p>

<p>The colour of the luminosity due to <span class="correction" title="amended from postive">positive</span> rays is not in
general the same as that due to anode rays; the difference is
exceptionally well marked in helium, where the cathode ray
luminosity is blue while that due to the positive rays is red.
The luminosity produced when the rays strike against solids
is also quite distinct. The cathode rays make the body emit
a continuous spectrum, while the spectrum produced by the
positive rays often shows bright lines. Thus lithium chloride
under cathode rays gives out a steely blue light and the spectrum
is continuous, while under the positive rays the salt gives out a
brilliant red light and the spectrum shows the red helium line.
It is remarkable that the lines on the spectra of the alkali metals
are much more easily produced when the positive rays fall on
the oxide of the metal than when they fall on the metal itself.
Thus when the positive rays fall on a pool of the liquid alloy
of sodium and potassium the specks of oxide on the surface
shine with a bright yellow light while the untarnished part of
the surface is quite dark.</p>

<p>W. Wien (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 65, p. 445) measured the values of
e/m for the particles forming the positive rays. Other measurements
have been made by Ewers (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 69, p. 167) and
J. J. Thomson (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> 13, p. 561). The differences between
the values of  e/m for the cathode and positive rays are very
remarkable. For cathode rays whose velocity does not approach
that of light, e/m is always equal to 1.7&times;10<span class="sp">8</span>,  while for the positive
rays the greatest value of this quantity yet observed is 10<span class="sp">4</span>,
which is also the value of e/m for the hydrogen ions in the electrolysis
of dilute solutions. In some experiments made by J. J.
Thomson (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 14, p. 359) it was found that when the
pressure of the gas was not too low the bright spot produced by
the impact of a pencil of these rays on a phosphorescent screen
is deflected by electric and magnetic forces into a continuous
band extending on both sides of the undeflected position. The
portion on one side is in general much fainter than that on the
other. The direction of this deflection shows that it is produced
by particles charged with negative electricity, while the brighter
band is due to particles charged with positive electricity. The
negatively electrified particles which produce the band c.c are
not corpuscles, for from the electric and magnetic deflections
we can find the value of e/m. As this proves to be equal to 10<span class="sp">4</span>,
we see that the mass of the carrier of the negative charge is
comparable with that of an atom, and so very much greater
than that of a corpuscle. At very low pressures part of the
phosphorescence disappears, while the upper portion breaks up
into two patches (fig. 27). For one of these the maximum value
of e/m is 10<span class="sp">4</span> and for the other 5&times;10<span class="sp">3</span>. At low pressures the
appearance of the patches and the values of e/m are the same
whether the tube is filled originally with air, hydrogen or
helium. In some of the experiments the tube was exhausted
until the pressure was too low to allow the discharge to pass.
A very small quantity of the gas under investigation was then
admitted into the tube, just sufficient to allow the discharge to
pass, and the deflection of the phosphorescent patch measured.
The following gases were admitted into the tube, air, carbonic
oxide, oxygen, hydrogen, helium, argon and neon, but whatever
the gas the appearance of the phosphorescence was the same;
in every case there were two patches, for one of which e/m = 10<span class="sp">4</span>
and for the other e/m = 5&times;10<span class="sp">3</span>. In helium at higher pressures
another patch was observed, for which e/m = 2.5&times;10<span class="sp">8</span>. The
continuous band into which the phosphorescent spot is drawn
out when the pressure is not exceedingly low, which involves
the existence of particles for which the mean value of e/m varies
from zero to 10<span class="sp">4</span>, can be explained as follows. The rays on their
way to the phosphorescent screen have to pass through gas
which is ionized by the passage through it of the positive rays;
this gas will therefore contain free corpuscles. The particles
which constitute the rays start with a charge of positive electricity.
Some of these particles in their journey through the
gas attract a corpuscle whose negative charge neutralizes the
positive charge on the particle. The particles when in this
neutral state may be ionized by collision and reacquire a positive
charge, or by attracting another particle may become negatively
charged, and this process may be repeated several times on their
journey to the phosphorescent screen. Thus some of the particles,
instead of being positively charged for the whole of the time
they are exposed to the electric and magnetic forces, may be
for a part of that time without a charge or even have a negative
charge. The deflection of a particle is proportional to the
average value of its charge whilst under the influence of the
deflecting forces. Thus if a particle is without a charge for a
part of the time, its deflection will be less than that of a particle
which has retained its positive charge for the whole of its journey,
while the few particles which have a negative charge for a
longer time than they have a positive will be deflected in the
opposite direction to the main portion and will produce the tail
(fig. 27).</p>

<p>A similar explanation will apply to the positive rays discovered
by Villard (<i>Comptes rendus</i>, 143, p. 674) and J. J. Thomson
(<i>Phil. Mag.</i> 13, p. 359), which travel in the opposite direction to
the rays we have been considering, <i>i.e.</i> they travel away from the
cathode and in the direction of the cathode&rsquo;s rays; these rays
are sometimes called &ldquo;retrograde&rdquo; rays. These as far as has
been observed have always the same maximum value of e/m,
<i>i.e.</i> 10<span class="sp">4</span>,  and there are a considerable number of negative ones
always mixed with them. The maximum velocity of both the
positive and retrograde rays is about 2&times;10<span class="sp">8</span> cm./sec. and varies
very little with the potential difference between the electrodes
in the tube in which they are produced (J. J. Thomson, <i>Phil.
Mag.</i>, Dec. 1909).</p>

<p>The positive rays show, when the pressure is not very low, the
line spectrum of the gas through which they pass. An exceedingly
valuable set of observations on this point have been made
by Stark and his pupils (<i>Physik. Zeit.</i> 6, p. 892; <i>Ann. der
Phys.</i> 21, pp. 40, 457). Stark has shown that in many gases,
notably hydrogen, the spectrum shows the Doppler effect, and he
has been able to calculate in this way the velocity of the positive
rays.</p>

<p><i>Anode Rays.</i>&mdash;Gehrcke and Reichenhein (<i>Ann. der Phys.</i> 25,
p. 861) have found that when the anode consists of a <span class="correction" title="amended from mixure">mixture</span> of
sodium and lithium chloride raised to a high temperature either
by the discharge itself or by an independent heating circuit, very
conspicuous rays come from the anode when the pressure of the
gas in the discharge tube is very low, and a large coil is used to
produce the discharge. The determination of e/m for these rays
showed that they are positively charged atoms of sodium or
lithium, moving with very considerable velocity; in some of
Gehrcke&rsquo;s experiments the maximum velocity was as great as
1.8&times;10<span class="sp">7</span> cm./sec. though the average was about 10<span class="sp">7</span> cm./sec.
These velocities are less than those of the positive rays whose
maximum velocity is about 2&times;10<span class="sp">8</span> cm./sec.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FnAnchor_1"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The values for nickel and bismuth given in the table are much
higher than later values obtained with pure electrolytic nickel and
bismuth.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FnAnchor_2"><span class="fn">2</span></a> The value here given, namely 12.885, for the electric mass-resistivity
of liquid mercury as determined by Matthiessen is now
known to be too high by nearly 1%. The value at present accepted
is 12.789 ohms per metre-gramme at 0° C.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FnAnchor_3"><span class="fn">3</span></a> The value (1630) here given for hard-drawn copper is about
¼% higher than the value now adopted, namely, 1626. The difference
is due to the fact that either Jenkin or Matthiessen did not
employ precisely the value at present employed for the density of
hard-drawn and annealed copper in calculating the volume-resistivities
from the mass-resistivities.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FnAnchor_4"><span class="fn">4</span></a> Matthiessen&rsquo;s value for nickel is much greater than that obtained
in more recent researches. (See Matthiessen and Vogt, <i>Phil. Trans.</i>,
1863, and J. A. Fleming, <i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i>, December 1899.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FnAnchor_5"><span class="fn">5</span></a> Matthiessen&rsquo;s value for mercury is nearly 1% greater than the
value adopted at present as the mean of the best results, namely
94,070.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6" href="#FnAnchor_6"><span class="fn">6</span></a> The samples of silver, copper and nickel employed for these tests
were prepared electrolytically by Sir J. W. Swan, and were exceedingly
pure and soft. The value for volume-resistivity of nickel as
given in the above table (from experiments by J. A. Fleming, <i>Proc.
Roy. Soc.</i>, December 1899) is much less (nearly 40%) than the value
given by Matthiessen&rsquo;s researches.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FnAnchor_7"><span class="fn">7</span></a> The electrolytic bismuth here used was prepared by Hartmann
and Braun, and the resistivity taken by J. A. Fleming. The value
is nearly 20% less than that given by Matthiessen.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8" href="#FnAnchor_8"><span class="fn">8</span></a> In 1899 a committee was formed of representatives from eight
of the leading manufacturers of insulated copper cables with delegates
from the Post Office and Institution of Electrical Engineers, to
consider the question of the values to be assigned to the resistivity
of hard-drawn and annealed copper. The sittings of the committee
were held in London, the secretary being A. H. Howard. The values
given in the above paragraphs are in accordance with the decision
of this committee, and its recommendations have been accepted by
the General Post Office and the leading manufacturers of insulated
copper wire and cables.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9" href="#FnAnchor_9"><span class="fn">9</span></a> Platinoid is an alloy introduced by Martino, said to be similar
in composition to German silver, but with a little tungsten added.
It varies a good deal in composition according to manufacture, and
the resistivity of different specimens is not identical. Its electric properties
were first made known by J. T. Bottomley, in a paper read
at the Royal Society, May 5, 1885.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10" href="#FnAnchor_10"><span class="fn">10</span></a> An equivalent gramme molecule is a weight in grammes equal
numerically to the chemical equivalent of the salt. For instance, one
equivalent gramme molecule of sodium chloride is a mass of 58.5
grammes. NaCl = 58.5.</p>

(Leipzig, 1898).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12" href="#FnAnchor_12"><span class="fn">12</span></a> It should be noticed that the velocities calculated in Kohlrausch&rsquo;s
theory and observed experimentally are the average velocities, and
involve both the factors mentioned above; they include the time
wasted by the ions in combination with each other, and, except at
great dilution, are less than the velocity with which the ions move
when free from each other.</p>
